The remaining party - Dirisa Togola - headed by the Prime Minister , Sogeli Kokala Mayiga and his Minister of Information , M. Haruna Ture , attended this morning , June 28 , at the House of Representatives . ||| Ko min tɔ bɛ kɔ - Dirisa Togola - Minisiriɲɛmɔgɔ , Sogɛli Kokala Mayiga n'a ka Kunnafonidi minisiri Mɛtiri Haruna Ture dalen a kan , taara nin ntɛnɛndon , zuwɛnkalo tile 28 , Kunnafonidalaw ka Soba la .
The purpose of this visit to the House of Representatives was to raise awareness among the media about the first steps of the transitional government , which included land acquisition , political and humanitarian reform , and the promotion of human rights . ||| Nin balimayataama ka taa bɔ Kunnafonidalaw ka Soba la laɲini tun ye ka kunnafonidilaw ladɔnniya furancɛlafanga gɔfɛrɛnaman ka baara kɛta fɔlɔfɔlɔw la , minnu ye jamana dugukolo lakanani , politikikow ni fangabulonkow yɛlɛmaniw , ani hadamadenyasiraw basigili ye .
The Prime Minister used this occasion to announce the birth of the next National Assembly . ||| Minisiriɲɛmɔgɔ ye nin ko kɛ sababu ye ka Jamana Labɛn kura Lajɛbaw nata kɛli bange kunnafondilaw ye .
In addition , a separate dispute resolution body was also set up for the forthcoming elections . ||| Ani fana , kalataw ɲɛnabɔli cakɛda kelen pe bilali nata telin sen kan .
This was done in the presence of the President of the House of Representatives , Banjugu Dante . ||| O tun kɛra Kunnafonidalaw ka Soba perezidan , Banjugu Dante , ɲɛna
In his criticism of the visit , the Speaker of the House of Representatives , Dante , cited the government 's reluctance to censor the media in Mali . ||| A ka bisimilali kɔrɔfɔ la , Kunnafonidalaw ka Soba perezidan , Dante , ye gɔfɛrɛnaman hakililatigɛ Mali kunnafonidilaw ka bilasirali la .
As a result of this visit , he paid tribute to the hard work of the Head of State of Mali on issues that affect the daily lives of journalists . ||| A kɛtɔla ka nin taama kɛ sababu ye , a y'i sara , k'a gɛlɛya , Mali mara ɲɛmɔgɔ la , gɛlɛyaw kan , minnu bɛ ka kunnafonidilaw ka don bɛɛ kow fanga ban .
It is not possible to retrieve data after a data structure has been restored . ||| Labɛn kura tɛ se ka sɔrɔ , kunnafonidi labɛn kura kɔ .
He broke this . ||| A ye nin dantigɛ .
According to him , some of the challenges facing Mali 's media include the new football censorship law , the detention of journalists , the lack of media support for the last three years , the burden of corruption , the lack of transparency , and the lack of accountability of the audiovisual industry . ||| Ale bolo , Mali kunnafonidi bɛ ka tɛmɛ gɛlɛya minnu fɛ , olu dɔw ye bɔlɔlɔkankojugukɛ sariya kura ɲangili ye , kunnafonidilaw minɛni daliluntanw , kunnafonidi dɛmɛ dibaliya , kun tɛ min na kabini san saba , wusuruw doniw , minnu ta man di , yan kɛnyɛrɛye lamɛnnifɛnw ni filɛlifɛnw cakɛda
by others and the need for the reconstruction of the House of Commons ||| dɔw fɛ ani Kunnafonidalaw ka Soba baarali kura laɲini
PEMU is a reminder to media professionals to find a solution to their stated goals . ||| PeYℇMu ye kunnafonidibaara kɛbagaw hakililatigɛ fura sɔrɔli la u ka laɲini kofɔlenw na .
Regarding his visit , Dr. Sogyal Kokala Mayiga said , ||| A ka taama kun kan , Dɔgɔtɔrɔ Sogɛli Kokala Mayiga bɛn'a fɔ ko ,
At the invitation of the President of the Central Bank , we decided to hold a gala evening. to strengthen the institutions of the Central Bank , and to continue the search for accountability of the people of Mali . ||| cɛmancɛlafanga perezidan ka yamaruyali kɔnɔ , an y'a ŋaniya ka galabu don kɛ . ka cɛmancɛ fanga taabolow sennateliya , ni ka to malidenw ka sendonni ɲini na .
And he said to them , " The power of the Middle One resides in the threefold cord " . ||| Ani k'a fɔ u ye ko cɛmancɛ fanga bɛ sigi ntuloma saba kan .
And he said to them , ||| K'a dɔn k'a fɔ ,
The first problem is that of security ; as long as there is no corruption in the security sector , citizens will always doubt the ability of the international community to solve problems . ||| ntuloma fɔlɔ ye lakana dakun de ye ; fo ka taa waati min kɛ , ni lafisayali ma kɛ lakanna sira la , fasodenw bɛ to kudayi ka siga furancɛlafanga se la ka gɛlɛyaw ɲɛnabɔ .
The matter is in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces . ||| O koɲɛ bɛ kɛlɛbolow ɲɛmɔgɔba ka bolo kan .
The second part , political revolution , focuses on political and social changes in the hands of the government . ||| Dakun filanan kunkan , min ye politiki ntuloma ye , politikow ani fangabulonkow yɛlɛmaniw bɛ gɔfɛrɛnaman ka bolo kan .
These changes need to be made with all accountability . ||| O yɛlɛmaniw ka kan ka kɛ ni bɛɛ sendonni ye .
Jesus replied , " It is not for me to say " . ||| Ko ale ma sira sɔrɔ k'a fɛla fɔ .
Until he decides to cast you aside . ||| Fo n'a y'a yɛrɛ ŋaniya k'i bila kɛrɛfɛ .
he justified it . ||| a y'o hakililatigɛ .
It dates back to the earliest manuscript , which was not the subject of discussion when it was prepared . ||| K'a kɔdon kalata donjatesɛbɛn fɔlɔ ma , min ma kɛ kumafalenw kun ye a labɛnni tuma na .
PEMU promised that any new constitution adopted by the government would be consensual , with the participation of all political and civil society leaders . ||| PeYℇMu ye lahidu di ko gɔfɛrɛnaman bɛ donjatesɛbɛn kura min ta , bɛna kɛ bɛnkan kɔnɔ , ko politikinw ani jamajɛrɛkuluw ɲɛmɔgɔw bɛɛ da bɛna don a la .
In order to move to a hypothesis , it is necessary to reduce the risk of belief and disbelief , as in previous hypotheses . ||| Walasa ka taa kalafili la , danaya bɛ min na ani k'a sɔsɔliw faratiw dɔgɔya , i n'a fɔ kalafili tɛmɛnenw ta ɲɔgɔnna .
On the other hand , ||| Fan wɛrɛ fɛ ,
According to him , politicians and members of civil society felt that at least one institution for conflict resolution was necessary . ||| Ale ka fɔ la , politikimɔgɔw ani jɛrɛjɛkuluw mɔgɔw y'a jateminɛ ko kalafiliw ɲɛnabɔli cakɛda kelen pe de ka kan .
Within nine months the government said it could not be done , unless he was found guilty or acquitted . ||| Kalo kɔnɔntɔn kɔnɔ gɔfɛrɛnaman ko a tɛ se ka kɛ , n m'a fɔ a jalaki don walima a jo don .
But they couldn 't prove that it couldn 't be done in 18 months . ||| Nka u ma se k'a jira kɛnɛ kan k'a tɛ se ka kɛ kalo 18 kɔnɔ .
I brought together experts and the former head of the SENI who used to organize protests , and put them to work to see if there could be a single agency to deal with protests , and the Ministry of National Heritage . ||| N ye mɔgɔ faamulenbaw fara ɲɔgɔn kan ani SENI ɲɛmɔgɔ kɔrɔ minnu delila ka kalataw labɛn , k'u bila baara la walasa k'a filɛ ni kalataw ɲɛnabɔli cakɛda kelen pe bɛ se ka kɛ walima a tɛ se , ani jamana marako minisiri ye .
Some of our more knowledgeable representatives took the floor , presided over by myself , after a three-hour meeting . ||| An ka mɔgɔ faamuyalenbaw ye kuma kuncɛ k'a bɛ se ka kɛ , lɛrɛ saba ɲɔgɔnye kɔfɛ , ne yɛrɛ ye min ɲɛmɔgɔya kɛ .
So , who couldn 't do it for nine months , ||| O la , min ma se ka kɛ kalo kɔnɔntɔn kɔnɔ ,
We got the answer in ten months . ||| an y'o jaabi sɔrɔ kalo tan kɔnɔ .
His political career was cut short . ||| A politlilatigɛ tara .
There will be no talk about whether or not there will be a single dispute resolution body . ||| Kumafalenw tɛna kɛ bilen ko awɔ walima ayi kalafiliw ɲɛnabɔli cakɛda kelen pe bɛna kɛ .
He said it was intentional . ||| A ko ŋaniya tara .
There will be at least one step taken to resolve the issues . ||| Cakɛda kannabilalen kelen pe kalataw ɲɛnabɔli la bɛna kɛ .
The question that remains is how will all of this be implemented ? ||| Ɲininkali min tora , ye nin bɛɛ bɛna waleya cogo di ?
We will prepare the conditions , and the leaders will help us to implement it as soon as possible . ||| An bɛna cogoyaw labɛn , a ɲɛdɔnbagaw bɛna an dɛmɛ bilali la sen kan teliyaba la , min bɛ se ka kɛ .
With determination and determination . ||| Ni cɛsiri ani koɲɛdɔn ye .
We will put the whole thing in motion in such a short period of time so that the necessary arrangements can be made . ||| An bɛna a ko bɛɛ bila sen kan nin ɲɔgɔnna waati kunkurunnin kɔnɔ yaasa ka kalataw labɛn .
This was the birth of the PEMI Foundation . ||| PeYℇMu Sogɛli ye nin bange .
The next National Planning Conferences will be held soon . ||| Jamana Labɛn kura Lajɛbaw kunkan , u bɛna kɛ sɔɔni .
The challenges of the DAY ( the day on which all national dialogue takes place ) will be their focus . ||| DeYℇNI ( Jamana kumaɲɔgɔnya bɛɛ sen bɛ min na ) komagɛlɛyaliw bɛna kɛ u selikɛgafe ye .
No foot will slip from it , not even a powerful one . ||| Mɔgɔ si sen tɛna bɔ a la , hali fanga kɔrɔ mɔgɔbaw .
Originally , the Deity was an idealized representation of the sovereign . ||| A sinti la , o DeYℇNI tun ye fanga ngarandabagaw ka hakilila talen ye .
However , due to the President 's failure to implement their demands , suspicion arose among his constituents . ||| Nka k'a da u komagɛlɛyaliw waleyalibaliya cogoya kan Jamana perezidan fɛ , sigaɲɔgɔnna donna a fanw mɔgɔw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ .
He pointed this out , adding that from the ground up everything was ready for him except for the preparation of the new National Assembly . ||| a y'o jira , yann'a ka fara a kan ko k'a daminɛ duguma fo sanfɛ bɛɛ bɛn'a fɛla fɔ Jamana Labɛn kura Lajɛbaw ɲɛli kama .
It is the will of the people that will be exercised by the newly installed president in the executive branch , subject to his executive powers . ||| Fasojama ŋaniya o de bɛna labaara perezidan kura sigilen fɛ bɛnkanfanga kɔnɔ , k'a da a ka jamanabaara baarabolodalenw kɔrɔ .
Today , we even have the means in the constitution to seek the impeachment or removal of the president of the country , who has deliberately betrayed the interests of the nation . ||| Bi , fo fɛɛrɛw ka kɛ an bolo sariyasunba kɔnɔ ka jamana perezidan , min y'a ŋaniya ka fasojama ka nafaw janfa , ka baarabila walima binni ɲini .
He stopped our rulers from doing as they pleased . ||| K'a bali an ka perezidanw ye , u ka fɛnw kɛ minnu mana u diya ,
Now it is up to the people to make their own constitution , not the intellectuals . ||| Sisan kɔni , fasojama de ka kan k'a ka sariyasunba dilan , a kana kɛ mɔgɔ faamuyalenbaw ye .
He squeezed it out of his mouth forcefully . ||| A y'o burun ka bɔ a da ni fanga ye .
On the issue of human rights abuses , especially threats against UNITED NATIONS , PACE reminded the audience that there is a need for dialogue with trade union leaders in order to resolve the issue of unemployment . ||| Hadamadenyasiraw basigili kuma kan , janko IYℇNITℇMu ka bagabagaliw la , PeYℇMu ye lamɛnnijama hakililatigɛ ko fɔkabɛnw bɛ senna ni baarakɛlaw lafasalijɛkulu ɲɛmɔgɔw ye walasa ka baarabila ɲari bɔ a ma .
He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Jara-Giyomu Prison . ||| Alu Badara Jara - Giyomu Soro ɲangira a kɔkiri la , a si kaso , Konowari kirida fɛ .
The former prime minister of Conakry was charged with attempting to overthrow the government . ||| Konowari minisiriɲɛmɔgɔ kɔrɔ jalakira k'a bɛ fɛ ka dankari jamana basigi la .
Her grandmother Afusiatu Banba Lamini , her bishop Sulutusulu , a former deputy of Benisuku , was imprisoned for 20 years . ||| A ka awokamuso Afusiyatu Banba Lamini , a ka bisimilada ɲɛmɔgɔ Sulutusulu , depite kɔrɔ Bɛnisuku , san 20 dara olu kun .
He was the son of Alen Lobon , the brother of Simon , and the nephews of Rigobert Soros and Pharisees Secundus . ||| Min ye Alɛn Loboɲɔn , balimakɛ Simon ninnu ani Rigobɛri Soro ni Falisiyebu Sekongo ye ,
They were sentenced to 17 months in prison for destroying property . ||| Olu ɲangira ni kalo 17 kasolabila ye forobabasigi tiɲɛni kosɔn .
Kirida also referred to the political ideology of Guillaume Soro , the " Solidarity Generation " . ||| Kirida ye Giyomu Soro ka politikitɔn , """" Zenerasiyɔn e pepulu solidɛri """" cili fana kofɔ .

The Civic Society , whose members numbered in the hundreds , staged a series of uprisings along the way , making this colonization , which transcended tribal and political boundaries , a defining feature of the " civic " movement . ||| Sigidalajamakulu , minnu b'a kɔnɔ k'u caya , ye wulikajɔw kɛ sira bɛɛ kan , ka nin maraboloko kɛ tiɲɛ ye , min bɛ tɛmɛ taafankow kan ani politiki jɛɲɔgɔnyakow , """" koladilankulu ye nin dantigɛ .
He added that this example of spirituality and determination should be emulated elsewhere , especially in the House of Bishops , which is sought after in all councils , and has been recognized by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and many others . ||| Yann'a ka fara a kan ko nin dusu ani cɛsiri misali ka kan ka lacaya yɔrɔ wɛrɛw la , janko Dalabaw marabolo la , min ɲininen don lajɛbaw bɛɛ kɔnɔ , n'a makɔnɔnen don Fagibini Sigicogo jamaw fɛ ani caman wɛrɛw .

Berehima Jalo - The first case to be tried by Archbishop Moti on Wednesday 21 June 2021 was between plaintiffs and Umaru Gajaga ( shepherd at Dedugu , Bankasi cemetery ) , who was charged with the murder of Nuhumu Sidibe . ||| Berehima Jalo - Ko fɔlɔ min kiri tigɛra Moti kirisigiba fɛ ntɛnɛdon zuwɛnkalo tile 21 san 2021 tun bɛ forobakiritigɛlaw ani Umaru Gajaga ( bagangɛnna min bɛ Dedugu , Bankasi kubeda la ) cɛ , ( o ) welelen kiri la ni Nuhumu Sidibe fagali ye .
She was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found not guilty of the charges against her . ||| Sɔn kɛlen a jalakili ma ko a sen bɛ kow la , a tun nɔminɛna minnu na , Umaru Gajaga ɲangira k'a bila a si kasolabila la .
What happened ? ||| Kow !
In the Scriptures , there are events that will happen after this : ||| Sɛbɛnw kɔnɔ , kow bɔra , minnu bɛ nin kɔfɛ ka na :
On the morning of February 18 , 2019 , in Dedugu , Fakala Rural Municipality , Jene Cercle , Umaru Gajaga went to the outskirts of the village to do some fishing . ||| Feburuyekalo tile 18 san 2019 , Dedugu , Fakala togodalayɛrɛmɛrakafo la , Jene sɛrɛkili kɔnɔ , sɔgɔma fɛ , Umaru Gajaga taara dugu kɔ la ka jɛgɛminɛ dɔɔnin kɛ .
Along the way , he meets a young boy , 13-year-old Nuhumu Sidibe , in his father 's garden . ||| Sira la , a ye kamalennin ncinin dɔ , Nuhumu Sidibe , min si bɛ san 13 la , sɔrɔ a fa ka nakɔ la .
After exchanging some difficult words , Umaru Gajaga painted several " " cupcups " " on Nuhumu Sidibe 's body , especially on his arms , legs , and head . ||| Kuma gɛlɛn dɔw falenfalennen kɔ u ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ , Umaru Gajaga ye """" kupukupu """" ɲɛ caman kɛ Nuhumu Sidibe la , o fari fan caman na , janko bolow , senw ani kunkolo .
The woman 's bleeding had stopped and she was naked in her place . ||| Nuhumu joli bonna k'a ban , w'a fatura a yɔrɔ la .
And his brethren seized him , and his brethren , at the commandment of his father , and led him away , and brought him before the governor . ||| Umaru minɛna a balimakɛw fɛ , a balimakɛw fɛ , a fa ka laɲini na , ka taa n'a ye dugutigi fɛ .
After a thorough investigation by the local branch of the Gendarmerie , based in Jene , Umaru Gajaga was charged with murder . ||| Sɛgɛsɛgɛli kunfɔlɔ kɛlen kɔ teliya la zandaramaw ka cakɛda bolofara fɛ , min bɛ Jene , Umaru Gajaga nɔminɛna mɔgɔfaga kama .
The accused was acquitted of the most serious charges against him . ||| Mɔgɔ jalakilen jɔra a ko fɔlenw la kasɔrɔ gɛlɛya ma kɛ a la .
She explained that on February 18 , 2019 , she found a boy , Nuhumu Sidibe , in their garden and , as she recalled , began to tease him because he had no hair on his head . ||| A y'a ɲɛfɔ ko feburuyekalo tile 18 san 2019 , ale ye cɛmisɛnnin Nuhumu Sidibe sɔrɔ u ka nakɔ la , i ko a delinako don cogo min na , a y'a daminɛ k'ale neni kasɔrɔ kun kalalaman si t'a la .
And in order to end his case , he approached Nuhum Sidibe and stabbed him several times with the knife he had in his hand . ||| Wa walasa k'a ka ko ban , a gɛrɛla Nuhumu Sidibe la , k'a sɔgɔ muru la siɲɛ caman ni kupukupu ye , min tun b'ale bolo .
This emphasis - on God - came to an end with the death of the late Nuhumu Sidibe at the hands of Umaru Gajaga . ||| O janko - Ala - la fɔli tun bɛ kun bɔ ka Umaru Gajaga jɔyɔrɔ ye cɛmannin Nuhumu Sidibe saya la .
Umaru replaced the older man . ||| Umaru nɔminɛna mɔgɔ nikaraba la .
But the heads of the longhorns were white . ||| Nka jandali walima dabɔnkama kunw tun y'a jɛ .
Thus , the case was interpreted to be murder within the meaning of articles 199 and 201 of the Penal Code . ||| O cogo de la , a kow faamuyacogo falenna k'a kɛ mɔgɔfaga ye ɲangilisariya sariyakisɛw 199 ani 201 ka fɔcogo la .
Therefore , it was found in the understanding of the facts , that the charges against Umaru Gajaga , allegedly in Dedugu , Fakala rural municipality , in Jene kubeda , on February 18 , 2019 , he committed against him and caused the death of Nuhumu Sidibe , the offences are covered and punishable by article 199 of the Penal Code . ||| O kosɔn , a yera kow faamuyali kɔnɔ , jalaki minnu bɛ bɔli kɛ , bɛ wuli Umaru Gajaga kɔ , k'a fɔ Dedugu , Fakala togodalakomini na , Jene kubeda la , feburuyekalo tile 18 san 2019 , a y'a dabɔ a kama ka saya lase Nuhumu Sidibe ma , ko minnu ɲɛsigilen don ni k'u ɲangi ɲangilisariya sariyakisɛ 199 sɛbɛnnisira
1 and 201 . ||| 1 ani 201 fɛ .
The accused subsequently confessed to the crimes for which he was convicted . In accordance with the rules of evidence , the accused 's affidavit of imprisonment no . 2 does not mention any penalty . ||| Wuli kɛlen don mɔgɔ min kɔ , o sɔnna k'a nɔ bɛ kow la , minnu jalaki binna a kan . Ka bɛn ni kibaruyabaw sira ye , jalakibagatɔ ka kasoko seereyasɛbɛn sɛbɛnfura n ° 2 tɛ ɲangili si kofɔ
The testimony about his physical body is good . ||| Kibaruya minnu sɔrɔla a ka mɔgɔyajogo kan ka fisa a ma .
But a psychiatrist , charged with running a psychiatric clinic , testified , as of 11 December 2019 , that there was no evidence of any physical or mental impairment that could have reduced the severity of his sentence . ||| Nka dɔgɔtɔrɔ faamuyalen , min bilala ka faamuyali boli a hakiliyanfan kan , ka laselisɛbɛn , ka bɛn ni desanburukalo tile 11 san 2019 ye , ko dimin si t'a kan farikolo walima hakili tiɲɛni sira fɛ , min bɛ se ka dɔ bɔ a ka ɲangili jɔyɔrɔtigiya la .
As a result , the judges converted the high-profile case into a murder case by ruling that the allegations against the accused , Umaru Gajaga , were exculpatory . ||| O sababu la , kiritigɛlaw y'a mɔgɔnikaraba kow yɛlɛma k'u falen ka kɛ mɔgɔfaga ye ni k'a dantigɛ ko ko minnu jate bɔra k'u kɔnɔkow falen k'u jɔ jalakibagatɔ Umaru Gajaga la jɛlen don ka se hakɛ la .
So they brought him before the Roman governor . ||| Kiritigɛlaw ye jalaki bin a kan o kosɔn , k'a bila Moti kirisigiba ɲɛkɔrɔ .
On the morning of Saturday , June 21 , 2021 , Umaru Gajaga , who has not been charged with any crime , stood trial for the charges against him , including forced labor , under the supervision of his lawyer , Master Simon Legu . ||| Bɔgɔ jeninen kan , ntɛnɛndon zuwɛnkalo tile 21 san 2021 , Umaru Gajaga , kasɔrɔ sɔsɔli ma kɛ a la , jɔra kow kɔrɔ , minnu tun jalaki binna a kan , ka baara gɛlɛya , o la , a ka awoka , Mɛtiri Simon Legu bolo . .
Defeated in battle by his allies , he had no choice but to appeal to the magistrates for mercy . ||| Kɛlɛ tiɲɛnen a bolo a ka mɔgɔ lafasata fɛ , se wɛrɛ tun t'o ye ni kiritigɛlaw ka hinɛ delili tɛ .
As a matter of fact , Umaru Gajaga and his ideas are not the same . ||| Bawo , a ka fɔ la , Umaru Gajaga n'a hakiliw tɛ ɲɔgɔn fɛ .
" " " " My character is mentally ill and mentally unstable . ||| """" Ne ka mɔgɔ lafasata man kɛnɛ , a n'a hakiliw tɛ ɲɔgɔn fɛ .

After recounting the events he was accused of , I ask for the judges ' mercy and forgiveness of the culprits " , he said on Wednesday . ||| A kɛlen ka kow lakodɔn , minnu jalaki binna a kan , ne bɛ kiritigɛlaw ka hinɛ ɲini ani nɔgɔyɔkunw """" a y'o soronadon .
But the prosecutor dismissed the rest , confirming that the accused had all the evidence and that his case was prepared against him . ||| Nka forbakiritigɛla y'a tɔ lajuguya , n'a tiɲɛtigiyali ye ko jalakibagatɔ sew bɛɛ dafalen don ani ko a ka wale in labɛnna k'a dabɔ a kama .
He was only interested in the details of the affair . ||| Nimisa dɔrɔn de donna ale la a kow kɔnɔkow falenni na .
Legu 's requests were ignored by the judges , who agreed that Umaru Gajaga was guilty and sentenced him to life in prison . ||| Mɛtiri Legu ka laɲiniw ma lamɛn kiritigɛlaw fɛ , minnu sɔnna ko Umaru Gajaga nɔ b'a la ni k'a ɲangi n'a si kasolabila la .
The special envoy of Siaka Dunbiya was sent to Seware-Sebaya for three matches , in which he scored seven goals against seven other players , but he did not score . ||| Siyaka Dunbiya ciden kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen bilalen ka taa Seware - Sebaaya saba , ko kɛ o ntolatan hakɛ kɔnɔ , ka celu wolonwula don mɔgɔ wɛrɛw la , foyi ma sɔrɔ ka don ale la .
With such a high level of evaluation , it was decided that Italy had the best chance of qualifying for the " Euro 2020 " qualifying tournament . ||| Ni nin bakurubajateminɛ ɲɔgɔnna ye , a tun bɛ latigɛ hakili la ko Itali sen bɛ """" Ero 2020 """" tɔn ɲumanw na , minnu ye balanna kɛ mɔgɔw la .
To such an extent that many people thought that the ability of the " " National " " to go to extreme lengths in meetings . ||| Ka se hakɛ la fo mɔgɔ caman tun y'a miiri ko se bɛ """" Naziyonale """" ye ka taa yɔrɔ janba la ɲɔgɔnkunbɛnw kɔnɔ .
To avoid this , the tournament itself was played in Austria during the eight pre-final matches ( or semi-finals ) in London . ||| Walasa k'o lasɔrɔ , fo se yɛrɛ tun ka kɛ Otirisi la ntolatan seginw senfɛ minnu b'a laban ɲɛ ( / witiyɛmu de finaliw ) , Lɔnduru .
In general , not the brightest in the foreground , but the always darkest in the background , all made the Austrians a target for the " Azur " squadron . ||| Bɛɛ la yelenkutabaw tɛ ɲɛfɛjɔw ta fan na nka kologɛlɛnw tuma bɛɛ kɔfɛjɔw ta fan na , fɛn bɛɛ tun bɛ Otirisikaw kɛ faden jandala ye """" Ɛsikuwadara Azura """" bolo .
And that was confirmed by the " " " " Wonderful " " " " football pitch over the green . ||| Wa o tiɲɛtigiyara """" Wɛnbileyi """" ntolatanyɔrɔ dawulama binkɛnɛ sanfɛ .

She revealed that when the search for interest began , without Ajara among the 17 of us , she was looking for her place in the team : Banba called her and told her that she wanted to join him and that she had to join him in order to get a place in the team . ||| A y'a jira ko diyagoya ɲinini tun daminɛna tuma min , ka Ajara to sans an 17 la , tun bɛ k'a filɛ k'a jɔyɔrɔ tɔn kɔnɔ : Banba y'a wele ni k'a fɔ a ye k'ale bɛ fɛ ka jɛ a fɛ ani k'a kan ka jɛ ale fɛ walasa a ka jɔyɔrɔ sɔrɔ tɔn kɔnɔ . Ajara banna .
During one of the FIBA World Championships , the incident escalated into a robbery : he [ Banba ] came into [ my daughter 's ] dining room and stabbed her 2 times . ||| FIBA ka diɲɛ kunbɛnniw dɔ senfɛ , o damatɛmɛ juguyara k'a kɛ binkanni ye : a [ Banba ] nana [ n denmuso ka ] dunanjiginso bon kɔnɔ sɔgɔmɔ nɛgɛkanɲɛ 2 .
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man 's cloak . ||| A y'a tɛgɛ minɛ , k'a maga a ( yɛrɛ ) fari yɔrɔ dɔw la
So he put his hands on her , and immediately she straightened up and left . ||| A y'a tɛgɛw don a ka kulusi kɔnɔ . Ajara bolila ka bɔ bon kɔnɔ .
After this defeat , Banba played Ajara 's first season in the professional basketball league . ||| O binkanni kɔfɛ , Banba ye Ajara ka basikɛtitanni waati sɛbɛkɔrɔdɔgɔya tɔn kɔnɔ .
Two other ancient texts describe similar events . ||| Tɔn basikɛtikɛlamuso kɔrɔlen fila wɛrɛw ye nin ɲɔgɔnnakow ɲɛfɔ .
Mary ( pseudonym ) was nicknamed Yumani by Uruguay 's Watusi when she was 15 years old , Banba attempted to join her in her hotel room during the team 's trip to a FIBA international tournament , only to be expelled from the team afterwards . ||| Mariyama ( tɔgɔ falennen ) y'a lakale Yumani Uruwayiti Wotisi ye k'ale tun bɛ san 15 la waati min na , Banba y'a ɲini ka jɛ ale fɛ a ka loteli bon kɔnɔ tɔn ka taama dɔ senfɛ , FIBA ka jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ kunbɛn dɔ la , ni k'a gɛn ka bɔ tɔn na , a ka ban kɔfɛ .
Mary also testified that Banba threatened the virgins with imprisonment if they reported his activities . ||| Mariyama y'a sɛmɛntiya fana ko Banba tun bɛ npogotigininw bagabaga ni kasolabila ye n'u y'ale ka kɛwale ninnu kofɔ .
A third witness , Umu ( a pseudonym ) , testified that when she was 17 years old , Banba tried to touch her breast and have intercourse with her . ||| Npogotiginin sabanan , Umu ( tɔgɔ falennen ) , y'a sɛmɛntiya ko tuma min ale tun bɛ san17 la , Banba y'a ɲini ka maga ale disi la ni ka kafoɲɔgɔnya kɛ n'ale ye .
When I refused , he wouldn 't let me vote . ||| Tuma min na n banna , a m'a to n ka tanni kɛ .
She put me on the sidelines of basketball games.Basketball players confided to the Human Rights Watch that Banba was having sex with local women under the age of 18 and some female basketball players , exchanging sex for basketball time , money and sports equipment . ||| A ye n bila kɛrɛfɛ basikɛtitanniw na .

In Mali , sexual intercourse with people between the ages of 15 and 21 is illegal if the perpetrator is an adult who has authority over the victim or the victim 's guardian or if the perpetrator is a parent or employer . ||| Mali la , kafoɲɔgɔnyawalew kɛli ni mɔgɔw ye , minnu si bɛ san 15 la ka se 21 ma ye sariyasɔsɔw ye , n'a kɛbaga ye baliku ye min ka fanga bɛ boli a tigilamɔgɔ kan walima n'a ka lamɔn b'a bolo walima n'a ba lakɔlɔsi walima n'a y'a ka baaratigi ye .
In the context of its supervisory role and in accordance with FIBA 's admission rules , it is the responsibility of the Mali Basketball Association to protect male and female basketball players from sexual harassment and to punish professional sexual harassment offenders with fines and expulsion . ||| A ka kɔlɔsilibaara hukumu kɔnɔ ani ka bɛn ni FIBA donni sariyaw ye , a bɛ Mali basikɛti faraɲɔgɔnkankulu bolo ka basikɛtikɛla cɛmanw ani basikɛtikɛla musomanw lakana ka bɔ damatɛmɛkow bolo ani ka degelikaramɔgɔ damatɛmɛko kɛbagaw bali ni ɲangiliw ye ani gɛnni .
According to the FIBA Juvenile Crimes and Adults with Disabilities Act , there is no excuse for sexual harassment and discrimination against male and female basketball players , including discrimination against minors by their coaches . ||| FIBA ka denmisɛnninw ka hakɛw lakanani ani farati bɛ baliku minnu ka kow la tuloman duuru ka fɔ la , yafa kelen si tɛ kɛ kafoɲɔgɔnyaɲini ani damatɛmɛniw jalakow la ka sin basikɛtikɛla cɛman ani basikɛtikɛla musoman ma , damatɛmɛko minnu bɛ kɛ ka sin balikubaliw ma u ka degelikaramɔgɔw fɛ sen b'o

Anxiety-related relapses and relapses can have long-lasting effects on people who have suffered from them , either physically or psychologically , such as panic attacks , fatigue , and post-traumatic stress disorder . ||| Diyagoya kafoɲɔgɔnyaɲini ni binkanniw bɛ se ka nɔw bila , waati jan tɛmɛnen kɔ , mɔgɔw la , minnu bɔra a la , farikolo walima hakili la , i n'a fɔ kamanagan , farifaga ani misimisi min ye degun kɔ kɔlɔlɔ ye degun kɔ .
The father who witnessed the incident , after finding his daughter Ajara , determined that the well-known basketball player had abandoned basketball after the fall of Banba . ||| Denfa min ye ko lakale , n'a y'a denmuso Ajara sɔrɔ , y'a dantigɛ k'o min ye basikɛtikɛlamuso ye , ɲɛdɔn bɛ min na kosɛbɛ , ye basikɛti bila Banba ka binkanni kɔfɛ .

Ahamari Mayiga , the founder of the " African-Malay Association for the Protection of the Expatriate Gene " , an organization that protects elite athletes and female athletes , recognized this . ||| Ahamari Mayiga , """" Porotɛkisiyɔn dɛ zeni ɛsipɔritifu an Afiriki - Mali """" ( Denmisɛn farikoloɲɛnajɛkɛlaw Afiriki ni Mali lakanani ) sigibaga , tɔn min bɛ farikoloɲɛnajɛkɛla cɛmanninw ani musomanw lakana , ye nin dantigɛ .
On the positive side , the Malaysian Basketball Association 's role was supposed to be to protect female basketball players , but no one is concerned about the unethical behaviour of these players.The association cautioned against its responsibility to investigate or prosecute . ||| A ɲɛ ɲuman kan , Mali Basikɛti faraɲɔgɔnkankulu jɔyɔrɔ tun ka kan ka kɛ ka basikɛtikɛlamusow lakana , nka mɔgɔ si tɛ hami ni nin farakoloɲɛnajɛkɛlaw ka cogoya ye , min tɛ bɛn .

Sexual harassment is a highly publicized issue in Mali , especially among athletes . ||| Cɛnimusoyako ɲankata ye gɛlɛya ye min walankatalen don kosɛbɛ Mali kɔnɔ , ka tɛmɛ farikoloɲɛnajɛlaw ka yɔrɔ kan .
A 2018 report by the National Institute of Statistics revealed that nearly half of all Malian women and girls aged 15 to 49 have been subjected to sexual harassment . ||| Jamana kow jatebɔli cakɛda ka san 2018 hakililaɲinkali dɔ y'a to a ka se ka tiɲɛtigiya ko Mali musow ani npogotigiw minnu si b'a ta san 15 la ka se 49 ma , tila bɛɛ , nin ɲɔgɔnna ɲankata sera u ma .
With the " " " Zolympic " " " " in Japan and the FIBA Under-19 World Cup approaching rapidly , FIBA and SEIU must take swift action to punish coaches and officials who do not stand up to their responsibilities . ||| Ni """" Ze zolɛnpiki """" ye , min bɛ kɛ Zapɔn ani FIBA ka basikɛtikɛla minnu tɛ san 19 bɔ ka kupu di mɔni , minnu bɛ ka gɛrɛ ka na teliya la , FIBA ani SeyIwO ka kan ka taabolow ta teliya la ka degelikaramɔgɔ minnu bɛ damatɛmɛkow kɛ ani ɲɛmɔgɔ minnu m'u jɔ u jɔyɔrɔ la

This is what President Hamani , better known as Yes , promised us last Saturday ( June 14 ) , when he called us to inform us of his intentions in a parable and remind us that he has no place . ||| Hamani Ɲangi , n'a bɛ fɔ a ma Wiye , ye nin de kalifa an na ntɛnɛdon tɛmɛnen ( zuwɛnkalo tile 14 ) , a y'an wele tuma min na k'an ladɔnniya a ŋaniya talen na ani k'an hakilatigɛ k'a nɔ t'a la .
A man of great alacrity and unassuming humility , Wiye takes on the best of roles based on corruption , infamy , and malice . ||| Aladɔn belebele bɛ cɛ min na ani majigin min bɛ mɔgɔ bɔ a dabolo kan , Wiye ye jɔsenw la ɲuman ta ka sin lanɔgɔli , tɔgɔtiɲɛ ani juguya ma .
It 's time to help him get it together ! ||| Waati k'a dɛmɛ k'a lajɛya !
We were rescued from this treacherous plot only a few days ago by a friend of ours in the United States . ||| An bɔra nin janfa kalama , min sirila a kama , nin y'a tile damadɔ dɔrɔn ye , an teri dɔ ka sira fɛ , min bɛ lamerikɛnjamana kan .
We know that the Malian can , at times , be cruel to his fellow-citizen for his own pleasure or for the sake of defaming him . ||| An b'a dɔn ko Maliden bɛ se , waati dɔw la , ka kɛ wara jugu ye a fasoden ɲɔgɔn kama k'o ka di a ye dama walima a lanɔgɔli diyanye fɛ .
However , it is hard to believe that the fans of the legendary coach would go to such lengths just to satisfy the need for a man whose best year in professional basketball is what he deserves . ||| Nka , anw tun bɛ ban ka da la ko Hamane Ɲangi tɔgɔtiɲɛbagaw tun bɛna sɔn ka se fo nin yɔrɔ in na walasa dɔrɔn ka cɛ mago sa , min ka sannayɛlɛn teliman basikɛtiboli ɲɛmɔgɔyabaara la ye ko ye a ka kan ni min ye .
We had to live with the fact that Mnu Haidara Ayisata Sise , who is known as Sato ( former President and National Councillor of Transition - SEYENITE member ) was kidnapped last May by some Malians living in South Africa , so that he would not become the President of South Africa . ||| Anw dun tun ka kan ka sigi ni ko bɛɛ ye , Mmu Hayidara Ayisata Sise , a bɛ fɔ min ma Sato ( wasaden kɔrɔ ani Kɔnsɛyi nasiyɔnali de la taransiziyɔn - SEYƐNITE mɔgɔ ) kɛlen kɔ ka wayiba mɛkalo tɛmɛnen Maliden dɔw fɛ , minnu sigilen don Afiriki woroduguyanfan fɛ , walasa a kana sigi ka kɛ Afiriki wasadenbulon

When someone is too small , you make people feel bad about things that they deserve . ||| Ni mɔgɔ ka dɔgɔn kojugu , i bɛ mɔgɔw juguya minɛ kow la u ka kan ni minnu ye .
To capture evil is to build a palace , and anyone who is a good citizen of Mali should be proud of it . If Mali becomes a great palace , especially for a woman , Haman the Great was its builder . ||| K'a juguya minɛ sabula sobajɔla don , mɔgɔ o mɔgɔ ye Maliden ɲuman ye , kan ka waso ni min ye .

The African Basketball League or African Basketball League ( formerly African Basketball Federation / NIBEYA Basketball Federation of Africa ) from 16 to 30 May 2021 in Kigali , Rwanda , attests to this ! ||| Basikɛti Ligi Afirika walima Ligi Afirikɛni de basikɛtiboli ( Afiriki basikɛtijɛkuluba / ƐNIBEYA dawulamaba kɛcogoya Afiriki ) k'a ta mɛkalo tile 16 la ka se 30 ma san 2021 , Kigali , Uruwanda , b'o seereya !
It was during his presidency that Mali won its first major tournaments at the club level ( the Joliba women 's tournament in 1995 ) and the national level ( the Samatassegue women 's tournament in 2007 in Dakar , Senegal ) . ||| K'a bɔ a la ko ale ka perezidanya de kɔnɔ Mali y'a ka bangun jɔnjɔn fɔlɔ ta ( jamakulufarikoloɲɛnajɛw la ) kulɔbuw ka dakun na ( Joliba musow san 1995 ) ani jamanaw tɔgɔlatɔnw ( Samatasɛgɛ musolamanw san 2007 Dakaru , Senegali ) .
While this extraordinary leader and worker has received praise and recognition throughout Africa and the world , in his own country , this experience has led to much hatred , malice , and hypocrisy . ||| N'o ye bonya ni tɔgɔ di nin ɲɛmɔgɔ min ɲɔgɔn tɛ ani baarakɛla koɲɛdɔnna in ma fan bɛɛ fɛ farafinna ani diɲɛ kɔnɔ , a yɛrɛ ka jamana kɔnɔ , o taamasira ye kɔniya , juguya fu , munafakiyako de caman lase a ma .
Nevertheless , the blessed Prince Haman has , for the first time , escaped from the traps that had been set for him since he emerged with his brilliant leadership style . ||| Nka , dugawuden min don , Hamani Ɲangi sera , waati bɛɛ , k'a yɛrɛ bɔ janw na , mɔgɔw ma ban minnu bilali la a ɲɛ kabini a y'a yɛrɛ jira n'a ka ɲɛmɔgɔyabaara kɛcogo ye , min y'a damanata ye .
And , of course , they 're happy in the dark ( they don 't have the courage to do it in the open ) since Haman Ngangi decided to resign from his position , ahead of schedule , four days ago ( 13 June 2021 ) so that FIBA can conduct its own investigations into these allegations . ||| Wa , siga t'a la k'u bɛ nisɔndiya la dibi la ( dusu t'u la k'a waleya kɛnɛ kan ) kabini Hamani Ɲangi y'a ŋaniya k'a jɔyɔrɔ bila , waati la fɔlɔ , karidon tɛmɛnen ( zuwɛnkalo tile 13 san 2021 ) walasa FIBA ka se k'a yɛrɛ ka sɛgɛsɛgɛliw kɛ nin bisigikumaw kan diyagoya
In a collaborative effort , which became a work of art in its own right , about a dozen basket-women ( white women , he says ) were sculpted in Mali . ||| jɛɲɔgɔnyaɲini na , min kɛra baara taabolo ye , basikɛtikɛlamuso mɔgɔ tan hakɛ ɲɔgɔnna kan ( funankɛninmuso ncininw , a ko bisigilenw kɛtuma ) Mali la .

Furthermore , the New York Daily News page in no way discloses that President Ngugi has made a formal request to visit the nuns in Mali . ||| O tɛmɛnen kɔ , Niyɔrikikaw ka nin don n'a dugujɛ kunnafonidisɛbɛn ka faseri t'a da kɛnɛ kan cogo si la ko perezidan Ɲangi ye diyagoya kafoɲɔgɔnyaɲini ta ka Mali basikɛtikɛlamusow sɛgɛrɛ .
But just as he rewarded us , he wanted to hand you over to investigators , beyond the curtain of time . All those who had served the Lord conscientiously or were close to him had fallen from the ranks of the conspirators . ||| Nka i ko a y'a sara an na cogo min na , farikoloɲɛnajɛ hakilimaya ani jogoɲumanya tun b'a fɛ ale k'i bila sɛgɛsɛgɛlikɛlaw ka bolo kan , a ka waatilajɔyɔrɔbila kɔfɛ .

Half of all the people who come from the northeastern provinces do not speak the language of a mountain warrior , who survives by fleeing Kidal to bring bricks to Guruma , who is suffering from insecurity . ||| Mɔgɔw tila bɛɛ bolo , minnu bɛ bɔ kɔrɔnfɛmarabolow la , o kuma t'a la k'a fɔ kulu marifatigi dɔ , min bɛ ka balo ni k'a fɛrɛbɔ Kidali fɛ ka taa biribara lase Guruma kɔnɔ , min bɛ ɲaniba kɔnɔ kaban lakanabaliya fɛ .
The decision to withdraw from the Ifogaz community and move elsewhere is a military decision , which is unfavorable to the government , which has softened its stance , allowing it to understand that the SeMA has acted alone in this matter . ||| Ka sɔn ka bɔ Ifogasiw ka sigida la , ka taa i cogo yɔrɔ wɛrɛw la , o ye sɔrɔdasiyafɛɛrɛ ye , min man di gɔfɛrɛnaman ye , n'o ka kuma kɛlen k'a sumaya a la , y'a to a ka faamu ko SeMA ye baara kɛ a kelen nin koɲɛ na .
Nevertheless , there has been some encouragement in recent months , if not since 2020 , when for the first time the Western powers ratified the Algiers Accord for Reconciliation and Reconciliation in Mali , a partial peace process . ||| Nin bɛɛ kɔ , Ifogasiw dusu dara nin kalo laban ninnu kɔnɔ , n'o tɛ kabini 2020 san , waati min siɲɛ fɔlɔ la Burudamɛ banbaganciw sɔnna Alize Bɛnkansɛbɛn , bɛn ani bɛnɲini kama Mali la , fan dɔ falenni taabolo ma .
During the all-party talks in Bamako in December 2019 , the envoys of Kidali were accused of illegally entering Mali . ||| Jamana kumaɲɔgɔnya , bɛɛ sen bɛ min na , senfɛ , Bamakɔ , san 2019 desanburukalo la , Kidali cidenw y'u sendonni Mali kelen pe ni tilabali kɔnɔ sɛmɛntiya k'a jɛya .
One of these critics , Moses Agi Ataher , is the current Minister of Children and Sports . ||| Nin kɔrɔfɔ fɔbagaw dɔlakelen , Mosa Agi Atahɛri ye Denmisɛnw ani farikoloɲɛnajɛw minisiri ye sisan .
Many other people from the town of Kidali are in the government , such as Alahamudu Agi Ilyeni , a Malian-based foreign minister . ||| Mɔgɔ caman wɛrɛw minnu bɛ bɔ Kidali dugu kɔnɔ bɛ gɔfɛrɛnaman kɔnɔ , i n'a fɔ Alahamudu Agi Iliyɛni , Maliden minnu sigilen don kɔkan ka minisiri .
The former governor of the Ifoqasi community , according to ATeTe , is not unknown in the Kidali Buddhist area . ||| Ifogasiw ka sigida gɔfɛrɛnɛri kɔrɔ o , ATeTe tila la , tɛ mɔgɔ ye min dɔnnen tɛ Kidali Burudamɛw ka yɔrɔ la .
If the ministers and ambassadors of the country take the path of Kidali again , it will undoubtedly be because it is the opening of these doors of the government to the indigenous peoples , who have remained in the country for so long . ||| Ni minisiriw ni jamana cidenw ye Kidali sira ta kokura , siga t'a la k'a fɔ a sabu ye gɔfɛrɛnaman ka nin daw yɛlɛni ye a yɔrɔ denw ye , min tolen don joli ye Jamana na .

It is created , re-created and extended . ||| A bɛ dilan , ka segin a kan k'a dilan ni k'a walaka .

While politicians revel in this political hypocrisy , the general public , on the other hand , is bloodied , regretting , and experiencing unprecedented turmoil . ||| Ni politikimɔgɔw bɛ k'u nisɔndiya nin politiki hohaho kɔnɔ , fasojama , ale , joli bɛ ka bɔn , bɛ nimakaran na ani ka lonbolanba ɲani kɔnɔ min ɲɔgɔn ma kɛ .

They ( the monkeys ) do not know that it is a process and not a person . ||| Olu ( bamakɔkaw ) t'a dɔn ko taabolo de y'a kun ye ani ko mɔgɔko tɛ .
This is why they are always in the streets looking for a chariot ( from the Greek " karissa " ) or chariot ( from the Greek " karēsa " ) that will take them back to where they left off . ||| O de kosɔn tuma bɛɛ u bɛ bɔlɔnw kɔnɔ ka karisa ( """" ikisi """" ) walima karisa ( """" igɛrɛki """" ) tagali laɲini , n'u t'ale kunkolo fɛ tuguni kasɔrɔ u ma kɔfɛlaw basigi .

They increased pressure on the ruling party , drawing hundreds of demonstrators to the streets for weeks , demanding the resignation of President Ibrahim Bubakar Keïta , who had been forced to resign by a coup . ||| U ye degunba fara u bolodala , min bɛ jamana ɲɛmɔgɔya la , ka mɔgɔlankolon kɛmɛ caman sama ka na bɔlɔnw kɔnɔ , ka dɔgɔkun caman kɛ , minnu ye perezidan Ibarahima Bubakari Keyita ka baarabila ɲini , min dun tun sigira ni bɛnkanfanga ye .
In their struggle , they have not been able to give the Malians a memorial to the founding of the country except IBEKA . In this very moment , a group of children from Kati Yala entered the dance on August 18 , 2020 . ||| U ka kɛlɛ kɔnɔ , u ma se ka hakililatigɛ di Malidenw ma jamana sigiɲɛsigi kan IBEKA kɔ .

Don 't move ! ||| Sɛgɛn fu !
After the government sat quietly , the situation gradually calmed down . ||| Gɔfɛrɛnaman sigilen kɔ diyagoya la , kow lataamali sumayara .
The Central Council of State ( Consejo Nacional de Transición / SEYENITE ) was set up under similar circumstances , mainly due to the highly fragmented nature of the judiciary of Mali 's social institutions , which complicates the process of censorship and collective prosecution that is highly sought after by all sides . ||| Jamana cɛmancɛlafanga kolatigɛjɛkulu ( Kɔnsɛyi nasiyɔnali de taransiziyɔn / SEYƐNITE ) sigira o cogoya kelenw na , janko k'a da Mali sigidajɛkuluw tigɛtigɛliba cogoya kan k'a bɔ ɲɔgɔn na kojugu , o min bɛ kankelenfɔ kɛli gɛlɛya ani bɛɛ sendonni min bɛ ka ɲini kosɛbɛ fan bɛɛ fɛ .
Doubt and uncertainty crept into the Republican leadership . ||| Siga - siga ani danabaliya donna Jamana ɲɛmɔgɔya la .
The civil and military factions of the Central Defence are not aligned . ||| Cɛmancɛ lafanga siwilibolo ani sɔrɔdasiw ka fan ɲɛw jɔlen tɛ taafan kelen na .
The subsequent explosion was the 24 May 2021 explosion . ||| Kɔlɔlɔ min tugura o la , ye mɛkalo tile 24 san 2021 fangabin ye .
Return to the starting point . ||| Seginnkɔ ka taa wuliyɔrɔ la .
Central Defence President Ba Ndawo and Prime Minister Mukutari Wani were gunned down near the presidential palace , nine months before the Central Defence was abolished , breaking the nation 's trust . ||| Cɛmancɛ lafanga peresidan Ba Ndawo n'a ka minisiriɲɛmɔgɔ Mukutari Wani bilala kɛrɛfɛ perezidan dankan fɛ , kalo kɔnɔntɔn ka kɔn cɛmancɛ lafanga banni ɲɛ , ka fasojama jigi kari .
Pressures were quickly suppressed to restore hope . ||| Pɛrɛndaw baribarila teliya la walasa ka jigifa di kokura .
The head of the military academy decided to take matters into his own hands . ||| Sɔrɔdasikulu fanga dafirila ɲɛmɔgɔ y'a latigɛ ka kow ta bolo la a yɛrɛ .
As a result , there is an increasing number of ethnic Filipinos in Mali . ||| O kosɔn , tɛgɛdiw bɛ ka caya ni Mali jamanamɔgɔ sugu bɛɛ ye .
For this new elevation , a special role was given to EMIN-ERFIPE , who presented his candidacy for the post of Prime Minister to the President of the Federation . ||| O wulili kura kama , niyɔrɔ duman dira ƐMISƐNKI - ƐRƐFIPE ma , min y'a ka Fɛɛrɛtigɛjɛkulu perezidan jira walasa o ka bila minisiriɲɛmɔgɔya jɔyɔrɔ la .
This move , which is the brainchild of the group 's critics , who are calling for transparency , raises questions that are of concern to many observers . ||| Nin taamasen , min ye hakilimaya ye nin jɛkulu kolaɲakalaw fɛ , minnu bɛ kulola ni sɛbaaya ye , bɛ ka na ni ɲininkaliw ye , jɔdaw bɛ minnu na , filɛlikɛla sɔmijantigi caman kun na .

In accepting Sogel as Prime Minister , did Colonel Asimi Goïta forget that the military coup d 'état on the political scene was the result of the failure of the politicians , whom Sogel had accumulated for three decades ? ||| A kɛtɔla ka sɔn Sogɛli la i ko minisiriɲɛmɔgɔ , Kolonɛli Asimi Goyita ɲinana wa ko sɔrɔdasiw suuruli politikikɛnɛ kan , o bɔra politikimɔgɔw ka dɛsɛ la kolokoto , Sogɛli bɛ minnu cɛla kabini san bi saba ?
By default , the majority of the members of the next government will be MPs . ||| Ka bisigi bɔ a la , gɔfɛrɛnaman nata mɔgɔ fanba bɛna kɛ ƐMISƐNKI ɲɛmɔgɔw ye .
We say to Sogel that there is a great difference between the administration and that of the State , which is a parliamentary or legislative body composed of all kinds of people , because they have different ways of doing things and different levels of influence . ||| An b'a fɔ Sogɛli ye ko danfaraba bɛ pariti ncinin walima wulikajɔjamakulu dɔ , mɔgɔ suguya bɛɛ bɛ min kɔnɔ , marali ni Jamana ta cɛ , bawo u kow kɛcogow an'u kolomayɔrɔw tɛ kelen ye .
Let those who boast that they are sovereign be ashamed . ||| Mɔgɔ minnu b'u dalateliya k'a fɔ ko Sogɛli y'a ko ɲɛnabɔbaga ye , olu ka kan k'u kɔfilɛ .
A man is judged by what he does , not by what he says . ||| Mɔgɔ bɛ minɛ a ka baara de ma , w'a ka kuma tɛ .
The President of the Technical Association fought behind the Prime Minister 's office , it is easy to understand that his goal was not to benefit Mali , but to translate his dream into reality . ||| ƐMISƐNKI - ƐRƐFIPE Fɛɛrɛtigɛjɛkulu perezidan ye kɛlɛ kɛ minisiriɲɛmɔgɔyaso nɔfɛ , mɔgɔ b'a faamuya nɔgɔya la k'a kun tɛ ka Mali nafa , nka k'a ka sugo de bayɛlɛma k'a kɛ tiɲɛ ye .

Thus , in order to demonstrate to the 20 million poor that it is possible to create a new Mali , Sogel must first remove the people from the streets , who are enslaved by the merchants in the constitution , reduce the number of garbage trucks in the streets , secure the premises of the supermarkets and lay the foundation for a hostile struggle . ||| O la , walasa k'a jira maliden miliyɔn 20 na k'a bɛ se ka Mali kura dilan , Sogɛli ka kan fɔlɔ ka mɔgɔw wuli ka bɔ sirabaw kan , minnu minɛnen don feerekɛlaw fɛ sariyasɔsɔ kɔnɔ , ka dɔ bɔ garibuw hakɛ la bɔlɔnw kɔnɔ , ka sannakalanyɔrɔw siyɔrɔw lakana ani ka kɛlɛ jugu ju don

Get rid of those things , and no one will inherit anything else . ||| K'o yɔrɔw bɔ a la , falenni wɛrɛ si ,

But the story of the day , tied to the excitement of the newly awarded Mancotto Museum of Natural History , finds itself in the narrative . ||| Nka don kibaruya min sirilen don Manankoto yɔrɔ fɛnbɔli yamaruyasɛbɛn diliko kura dusutiɲɛko la , o y'a yɛrɛ sɔrɔ kumafalen kɔnɔ .
According to the director , contrary to media reports , BEDEGOLDI - Mali did not pay any compensation for the collapse of the Mancoto report . ||| Ɲɛmɔgɔ ka fɔ la , k'a kɔdon fɛn na min bɛ fɔ kunnafonidilanw fɛ , BEDEGƆLIDI - Mali ma foyi sara Manankoto yamaruyasɛbɛn binni kama .

The situation was difficult , so he quit the job for everyone 's sake . ||| Kow cogoya tun ka goni , o la , a ye baara bila bɛɛ ka hɛrɛ kosɔn .

The proceeds from the sale of DAWO ( Department of Employment Insurance ) securities were transferred to the Ministry of Education , amounting to 190 000 S $ and the payment of the salaries of teachers , who are not in the Buguni municipality , amounting to 126 7 million S $ ( 126 142 431 S $ ) . ||| Fɛn sɔrɔlenw DAWO ( Baaraw sugudilisɛbɛnw ) feereli la bilabaliya u diyɔrɔ la , k'u hakɛ mumɛ se sefawari dɔrɔmɛ 190 000 ma ani lakɔlikaramɔgɔsaraw sarali , minnu tɛ Buguni komini kɔnɔ k'a hakɛ mumɛ kɛ sefawari miliyɔn 126 , 7 ( dɔrɔmɛ 126 142 431 ) ye .
In addition to other violations , which were found in the administration of Mayor Buguni , the failure of local authorities to enforce the minimum payment limit , amounting to US $ 53 million ( S $ 53,199,950 ) , and the failure to enforce the income tax on deposits , ||| Ani ko kolon wɛrɛw , minnu yera Buguni meri marali la , dugukolosɛbɛnw falenni wari sarata dɔgɔmanin dan sigilen minɛbaliya , k'a hakɛ mumɛ kɛ an ka wari miliyɔn 53 ( sefawari dɔrɔmɔ 53 199 950 ) ye ani wari sɔrɔta minnu bɛ bila kɛsu kɔnɔ kasɔrɔ sigi ma kɛ u kunna ,

And the hardest part to keep in mind , according to our informants , is that none of the Buguni meters , Mamuru Unkountable , receives unnecessary resources , amounting to 3.8 million sefwaris ( about $ 3,175,000 ) . ||| Wa ko gɛlɛyayɔrɔ min bɛ to hakili la , an kunnafonibagaw ka fɔ la , o ye ko Buguni mɛri , Mamuru Kulibali , kelen pe bɛ nafamafɛnw sɔrɔ a man kan ni minnu ye , k'a hakɛ mumɛ se sefawari miliyɔn 3 , 8 ( dɔrɔmɛ 3 175 000 ) ma .
Specifically , some Buguni mayoral staff members cited abuses found in the mayoral staff 's administration , both in law and in practice . ||| U jɛlen , Buguni meri baarakɛla dɔw ye lataamacogojuguyaw kofɔ , minnu yera meri baarakɛlakulu ka marali kɔnɔ , olu bɛ sariya sira la ani kɔnɔnasariya sira la .
Non-statutory expenditures in financial management are included . ||| Nafolobaara minnu tɛ sariya kɔnɔ warikow ɲɛnabɔli la , olu bɛ fara a kan .
The fact that our interlocutors have come to the conclusion that not all individual actors of the Marian liturgy fulfill their roles and responsibilities to the fullest extent is a problem that has a negative impact on the achievement of the desired outcomes . ||| An kumakɛɲɔgɔnw ka sɔrɔ ka tɛmɛ ni kuma ye ko Meri marakɛcogo kɛbagaw kelenkelenna bɛɛ t'u jɔyɔrɔw an'u ka jɔyɔrɔtigiyaw fa ka se a dan na , o ye ko ye , min nɔ juguman bɛ ye jaabi laɲininenw sɔrɔli la .
On the contrary , care taken in the context of the management of a school district prevents the municipality of Buguni from being more efficient and effective in providing services to its citizens . ||| O nɔ kan , majɛ , minnu lakɔlɔsira dugulensɛbɛn ɲɛnabɔli hukumu kɔnɔ , bɛ Buguni meri bali ka baara kɛ ka ɲɛ ani ka jaabi ɲuman sɔrɔ baaraw kɛli la fasodenw ye .
Regarding the management of the islands , our interlocutors assure us that Buguni Mary did not initiate the actions necessary to achieve the goals , mentioned to her , such as in this section , informing the inhabitants and their treatment during the initial colonization . ||| Min ye dugukolokow ɲɛnabɔli ye , an kumakɛɲɔgɔnw y'an ladɔnniya ko Buguni Meri ma walew daminɛ , minnu ka kan walasa ka laɲiniw lasɔrɔ , minnu kofɔra a ye , i n'a fɔ nin yɔrɔ la , fasodenw kunnafonini an'u minɛko damakɛɲɛnen dugukolodiw senfɛ .

Today , however , inventory control is not as common as it used to be at Buguni Meri , due to the lack of proper manuals for monitoring and controlling inventory . ||| Wa bi , baarakɛminɛnw jatebɔli bɛ cogoya min na Buguni Meri la , a tɛ kɛ ka ɲɛ , k'a da gafe kolomanw sɛbɛnbaliya kan walasa ka minɛnw kɔlɔsili n'u lakanani hakililatigɛ .

As a result , during the period covered by this report , a total of 5,152,000 saffron dollars was collected for the protection of the mangasans Luwansewaris , and the President of the Board of Trustees ( O ) donated a total of 130,000 saffron dollars to the Ministry of Finance , ||| O cogo de la , waati kɔnɔ baara kɛra min kan , sefawari dɔrɔmɔ 5 152 000 hakɛ mumɛ minɛnen na mangasanw luwansewariw siratigɛ la , baarakɛkulu min bilalen don nafolokow kunna ( o ) perezidan ye sefawari dɔrɔmɛ 130 000 hakɛ di wari sɔrɔtaw musakamarayɔrɔ la ,

The tragedy , which involves the Virgin Mary , is great for the mind . ||| Ko baratubaratuli cɛjugubaw . Tiɲɛniba , min bɛ Buguni Meri la , ka bon hakili ma .
Instead , our interlocutors explained that the head of the Buguni Education Authority , in accordance with the law , sent a bill to pay the salaries of the teachers who were expelled from the Buguni Municipal Assembly to Mary Mamuru Kulibali . ||| O nɔ kan , an kumakɛɲɔgɔnw y'a ɲɛfɔ ko Buguni Kalan Ɲɛmɔgɔyasoba ɲɛmɔgɔ ye , sariyasɔsɔ kɔnɔ , lakɔlikaramɔgɔ minnu bila ka taa ka bɔ Buguni galodugu yɛrɛmarakafo kɔnɔ , ka saraw waribɔli latigɛsɛbɛn lase Mɛri Mamuru Kulibali ma .
Thus , the investigative team found that , based on the lists published by the Ministry of Education , Buguni Mary , the mother of Kulibali , is the head of the School of Social Responsibility , which was transferred to the municipality , to decide on the implementation of the fees , without assuming the responsibility of the fees mentioned . ||| O cogo la , sɛgɛsɛgɛli baarakɛlakulu y'a kɔlɔsi ko , k'a da sarakɛsɛbɛnw kan , minnu dilanna Kalan Ɲɛmɛgɔyaso fɛ , Buguni Mɛri , Mamuru Kulibali , ye Sigida Kanmabɔlen lakɔlikaramɔgɔ , minnu bilala ka taa a ka komini kɔkan , ka saraw kɛli latigɛ , kasɔrɔ a sara kofɔlenw doni tali

As a result of the controversy , the Investigator 's Committee came to the conclusion that the Buguni Mary revenue collection does not comply with the strict minimum rate of land conversion tax established in the Planning Act during the period in which the work was undertaken . ||| Wa nafolotiɲɛ dan , sɛgɛsɛgɛlikɛla ka baarakɛjɛkulu bɔra a kan k'a fɔ ko Buguni Meri wari sɔrɔtaw musakatigi tɛ dugukolo yɛlɛmani wari sarata dɔgɔmanin dansigilen min sigira latigɛɲiniw kɔnɔ labato , waati kɔnɔ baara kɛra min kan .
Thus , after a brief examination by the researchers of the financial statements , the land transfer deeds , the period of time over which the work was carried out and the intentions , we put them under the financial statements , which are written on the financial statements , based on the period of time over which the work was carried out . ||| O la , sɛgɛsɛgɛsikɛlaw ka fɛsɛfɛsɛli surunnin kɔfɛ wari saralenw seereyasɛbɛnw , dugukolow yɛlɛmani gafew kan , waati kɔnɔ baara kɛra min kan ani latigɛɲiniw , an'u dali wari hakɛw kɔrɔ , minnu sɛbɛnnen don waari saralenw seereyasɛbɛnw kan , minnu sigilen don
In the decision-making process , it was found that the Virgin Mary received funds from the Archbishop of Canterbury in the form of grants , subject to certain land changes , amounting to less than the stipulated minimum . ||| latigɛɲiniw kɔnɔ , a yera k'a fɔ Buguni Meri wari sɔrɔlenw Musakatigi ye wari minɛ , dugukolo dɔw yɛlɛmaniw siratigɛ la , wari hakɛ , minnu ka dɔgɔn ni fɔlen dugumada ye .
The total number of grants , divided by the number of community-based initiatives and the number of grants funded by Musakatigi , is 24 095 950 sefawari , the work was carried out in 2018 and 2019 periods . ||| Dɔgɔyaliw hakɛ mumɛ , danfara dugumada sigilen latigɛɲiniw fɛ ani hakɛ minɛnenw wari sɔrɔlenw Musakatigi fɛ , ye sefawari 24 095 950 ye , baara kɛra san 2018 ani san 2019 waati minnu kɔnɔ .
As if that weren 't enough , in 2018 and 2019 other land changes resulted in no income tax on a total taxable income of more than € 29 million ( US $ 29,104,000 ) . ||| I ko n'o tun tɛ bɔli kɛ , san 2018 ani san 2019 dugukolo yɛlɛmani wɛrɛw la , wari sɔrɔta minɛni si ma lakɔlɔsi wari hakɛ mumɛ kan min ka ca miliyɔn 29 ye ( sefawari dɔrɔmɛ 29 . 104 . 000 ) .

For some , the Virgin Mary 's " manzekar " ( all-powerful ) appearance is also a response to the Inconceivable Mother Mary 's reluctance to make explicit descriptions of the supernatural . ||| Minnu bolo , Buguni Meri ka """" manzekarasi """" ( bɛɛdunfanga ) dan fana ye , Mɛri Mamuru Kulibali ka ban jaabi ye ka waatilabaaraw ɲɛfɔliw kɛ forobakow ye .

Finally , the fourth focuses on the feasibility , necessity , feasibility and timeliness of establishing one or more disaster management agencies to plan for future disasters and other emergencies , which are available to ensure the sustainability of the disaster process ( the Disasters Database ) . ||| Laban na , a naaninan sigilen don cogoya kan a bɛ se ka kɛ min na , wajibiyakow , fɛɛrɛlako minnu ka kan ani ɲɛ tɛ kɛ waati min kɔ , ka kalafiliw ɲɛnabɔli cakɛda kelen pe bila sen kan kalafili nataw labɛnni kama ani taasira wɛrɛ , minnu bɛ sɔrɔ walasa ka kalafili taabolo danaya yakubaya ( Kalafiliw Cidenba ) .

We do not intend to interfere with the investigation , which has been opened in Dakar ( Senegal ) , but we can , on the contrary , demonstrate that this allegation is based on a false premise , namely that Habib 's illness affects some children , who are beaten in the dark . ||| Anw t'a ɲini ka sira don sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɔrɔ , min dayɛlɛla Dakaru ( Senegali ) , nka an bɛ se , kelen , k'a jira ko nin koɲɛ in sigira ɲɔgɔn kan nkalon kan dɔrɔn , k'a da a kan Habibu ka sannayɛlɛn bɛ mɔgɔnin dɔw tɔɔrɔ , minnu bugulen don dibi la .

In his remarks , Prime Minister Sogele Kokala Mayiga highlighted that delaying the implementation of the Peace Agreement is one of the key priorities of the central government officials . ||| A ka kɔrɔfɔ kɔnɔ , Minsiriɲɛmɔgɔ Sogɛli Kokala Mayiga y'i dantigɛ ko Bɛn bɛnkansɛbɛn bilali sen kan sennateliyali ye cɛmancɛlafanga ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛko fɔlɔ jɔnjɔnw dɔlakelen ye .
He emphasized , also , that the covenant should be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the spirit of liberty , in a manner that is consistent with the principles of liberty and renewal . ||| A y'a tiɲɛtigiya , fana , ko bɛn bɛnkansɛbɛn ka kan ka bilali sen kan ni kɛcogoya ye kegunya bɛ min na , ni kɛcogoya ye kodilan ani kokura sɔrɔ hakilila bɛ min na .
He added that apart from the four pillars mentioned in the treaty , which are ||| A y'a fara a kan ko k'a bɔ jɔsen naani kofɔlenw na bɛn bɛnkansɛbɛn kɔnɔ , minnu ye
National unity , territorial integrity , sovereignty , as well as the presidential system and the observance of all religions in the Republic of Mali are common features , which are not covered by the treaty . ||| jamana kelenya , jamana dugukolo toli a cogo la , sagotigiya , ani fana perzidanfanga labɛn ani Mali Jamana ka diinɛw bɛɛ waleyaliko ye taabolo kelenw ye , bɛn bɛnkansɛbɛn bɛnkanɲini tɛ kɛ minnu na .
According to the President of the SECESIA , this is the first meeting of the SECESIA since the political changes in Mali , especially the appointment of a new Central Bank President , the appointment of a new Prime Minister and the appointment of a new Central Bank Governor . ||| SEYƐSIYA perezidan ka fɔ la , nin ye SEYƐSIYA ka ɲɔgɔnye fɔlɔ ye , kabini yɛlɛma kɛra politikiko la Mali kɔnɔ , janko cɛmancɛlafanga perezidan kura sigili , minisiriɲɛmɔgɔ kura tali ani cɛmancɛlafanga marabulon kura sigili .

Buwalem Sebihi argued that the purpose of this period was to account for the failure of the treaty to enter into force . ||| Buwalɛmu Sebihi y'a dantigɛ ko nin waatilabaara kun ye ka jate bɔ bɛnkansɛbɛn bilaliko la sen kan .
It commemorates the anniversaries of the Cessna missile strikes on Kidal and Kay , earlier in the year . ||| A ye hakilijigin kɛ SEYƐSIYA waatilabaara kɛlen na Kidali ani Kayi , san daminɛ na .
This delayed the treaty 's entry into force . ||| O waatilabaara olu senfɛ , kandi kɛra ka bɛnkansɛbɛn bilali sen kan sennateliya .
He was delighted to see all the parts of the treaty ( Government - SEMA - Platform - Defendant ) at this important session . ||| A nisɔndiyara ni bɛnkansɛbɛn fanw bɛɛ yeli ye ( Gɔfɛrɛnaman - SEMA - Pilatifɔrɔmu - Cɛfɔla ) nin SEYƐSIYA waatilabaara la .
For him , renewal was both a necessary condition for the validity of the treaty and a necessary condition for the speed with which the treaty was negotiated . ||| Ale fɛ , kandi lakurayalen kɛra bɛnkansɛbɛn bilalila sen kan ani fana a ka kan cogo min bɛnkansɛbɛn taamasen ka lateliya .

Under the old Lorian metric system , a military district was a circumscribed area . ||| Loriyan mɛri kɔrɔ bolo , sɔrɔdasiya yɔrɔ ye kɛnɛkanda ye .
Born in this wealthy military suburb , he was educated politically in the " Church of Zenit " , of which his parents were both members , and grew up near his hometown of Mugubon , which had long been involved in French arms manufacturing . ||| A bangenen nin kɛlɛkɔfɛdugu kɔnɔ , min ye tomo ye , a y'i kalan politiki la """" Zenɛsi uwiriyɛri keretiyɛnni """" kɔnɔ , a bangebagaw ye min tɔndenw ye , ani ka kɔrɔbaya a dugu mugubon kɛrɛfɛ , min mɛɛnna Faransi jamana kɛlɛkɛkurunw dilanni na .

This led to the following : In 2007 , Bertrand was invited by Nicolas Sarkozy , a graduate of the Faculty of Economics , to serve in an open government . ||| O ye nɔ bɔ : 2007 san kɔnɔ , Beretɔnkɛ welela Nikola Sarikozi fɛ , min ye san sɔrɔ Orowayali kan , ni ka baara kɛ gɔfɛrɛnaman dayɛlɛnenko la .

He remained in exile for five more years , until the French invasion of the Netherlands . ||| A bɛn'a yɛrɛ minɛ ka san duuru kɛ tuguni , fo Faransuwa Holandi ka sigili .

Ledrian is widely regarded as the greatest French military strategist and industrialist in northern France , where criticisms have been leveled at the ineffectiveness of the military dictatorship . ||| Mɔgɔw bɛɛ hakilina na , Lediriyan kɛra Faransi sɔrɔdasiyako ni izinibaarako taabolo dɔnbagaw bɛɛ la ɲuman ye , Faransi numanyanfan kɔnɔ , yɔrɔ min na dungew bɛ tuguni sɔrɔdasiyako juguyabagaw ka hakilina magoɲɛbali la .

The Minister of Africa is recognized as the President of the Republic ; he maintains friendships with most of the country 's leaders . If there is a region where Ledrian 's message is strong , it is Africa , especially the rainforest regions . ||| Afiriki Minisiri lakodɔnnen don i ko Jamanakuntigi ; a bɛ teriya sama ani bangun ɲɛmɔgɔw fanba bɛɛ cɛ .

When he took up his post at the " " Defense " " department , he was less familiar with this term than most , where French military officers hold a much higher rank . ||| Tuma min a y'a ka baara ta """" Defansi """" la , a dun tɛ nin bangun in dɔn ka se o bɛɛ ma , yɔrɔ min na sɔrɔdasidagaw bɛ Faransi bolo , minnu jɔda ka bon ka tɛmɛ .

The young man who is told that the African minister , under the Franco-Dutch charter , is welcomed as a president , draws the friendship of most of the leaders of the bloc , who recognize the influence of the Dutch media , agree with his policy of appeasement , and traditionally , trust him . ||| Kamalenyatɔgɔ fɔra mɔgɔ min ma ko Afiriki minisiri , Faransuwa Holandi ka saratiwaati senfɛ , bɛ bisimila i ko Jamanakuntigi , a bɛ teriya sama bangun ɲɛmɔgɔw fanba bɛɛ fɛ , minnu b'a ni Holandi cɛsiraw fanga dɔn , n'u sɔnnen don a ka jateminɛni politiki ye , a kɔrɔlen cogoya la , an'u bɛ danaya

To the point where , with a French and a Brazilian clown imitating his voice in front of him , he will be able to reach out to a few corrupt presidents and collect money from them , which will be donated to some French prisoners of war in Mali , in the form of a ransom . ||| Ka se yɔrɔ la , ni Faransi ani Banisirala mɔgɔ namaratɔba dɔ kɛtɔ k'a kumakan ladege a ɲɛma , bɛna se ka jan da bangun Jamanakuntigi damadɔw ye yaasa ka wari minɛ u la , min bɛ kɛ bolomafara ye Faransikaden dɔw minɛnen , k'u kɛ bolokɔnɔmɔgɔw ye Mali la , kunmabɔwari bisigilen na .

That 's not going to happen yet , I want it to happen after the presidential election . ||| O dun tɛ ka kɛ fɔlɔ , ne b'a ɲini o ka kɛ perezidankalata kɔfɛ .
If there is a requirement to bring it to the President [ of Mali ] , ||| Ni cikan bɛ yen k'o lase [ Mali ] perezidan ma ,
In any case , I will not participate in this charade , - it is up to the leaders to act in such a way that they will be able to rally with dignity against the violation of the Algiers Treaty , which the head of French foreign affairs threw away during a visit to Stockholm . ||| a ka kɛ nin ye walima dɔwɛrɛ , ne tɛna n sen don kalafili taabolo la , - cɛbɔw de ka kan k'a kɛ cogo la u k'u kandi ni danbetigiya ye Alize bɛnkanw bilali kama sen kan , Faransi jamana ni jamana wɛrɛw cɛkow kuntigi y'o fili fiɲɛ fɛ a ka taama dɔ kɔkan Ɛsitokolumu .

While the President of Mali received his counterparts in the capital of Mauritania , the inconsistency of the presidential timetable meant that Emmanuel Macron himself had to visit Mauritania on 2 and 3 July . ||| Tuma min Mali Jamanakuntigi y'a bɔɲɔgɔnw sɔrɔ Muritani faaba kɔnɔ , perezidanw ka waatibolodaw cogoya bɛnsenma y'a kɛ Emaniyɛli makɔrɔn yɛrɛ ka kan ka taama kɛ Muritani zuluyekalo tile 2 ani 3 .

It was directed against Lediriyan , to which the President of Mali replied , after turning to the bartender , facing him directly : if it 's a charity for me , it 's the opposite of this practice .

The problem is not unique to IBEKA , in particular . ||| A koɲɛɲini ma bala IBEKA la , kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenya la .
This was partially reversed , however , when the bill was rushed through the House of Commons , this time by the Minister of Defence , Zan-Ivi Lediriyan , and did so , according to our correspondents , several times in 2014 . ||| O dun seginna ka kɛ dɔɔnin , tuma min da sinna ka don Obɛritiri gafe la , nin sen , Lakana minisiri , Zan - Iwi Lediriyan , yɛrɛ fɛ , ni k'o kɛ , an kunnafonibagaw ka fɔ la , siɲɛ caman san 2014 kɔnɔ .

But between Paris and Bamako in the process , there seemed to be no end in sight . ||| Nka Pari ni Bamakɔ cɛ bɛ baara la a ɲɛ ma , w'a tun bɛ ye ko a ko laban tɛ se ka bali .
In the end , the president agreed , and our correspondent nodded his head . ||| Laban na , perezidan sɔnna , an kunnafonibaga y'a kuncɛ tan .
Overwhelmed by his unwillingness to negotiate , Ottawa tried to hang on to his property . ||| A ladɔnniyalen a ka bɛnkan lakurabaliya la , Otawa y'a ɲini k'i dulon a ka fɛn na .

According to a former member of the French Théâtre de Thalès ( the father of the Opéra at the time ) he also prepared the terrain to play a role in it , as he quickly recovered : people informed us that his book had been completely suppressed , our correspondent explained , with ||| Faransika Talɛsi baarakɛyɔrɔ mɔgɔ kɔrɔ dɔ ka fɔ la ( Obɛritiri faden a waati la ) fana y'a yɔrɔ dugukolo mɔmɔ walasa ka jɔyɔrɔ ta a la , nk'a y'a kɔmunu teliya la : mɔgɔw y'an ladɔnniya k'a gafe da sɔgɔra pewu , an kunnafonibaga y'o ɲɛfɔ , ni

As a result of the agreement with the Bank of Canada , since then only the United Kingdom sells passports , while Mali does not . ||| K'a kɔdon bɛnkansɛbɛn na ni Kanadiyan Bɛnki ye , k'a taa o waati la Obɛritiri de bɛ sin ka pasipɔri feere , wa Mali jamana t'a kɛ .
The passports issued by the French were of good quality , as they were very difficult to pronounce . ||| Pasipɔri dilenw faransikaw fɛ ɲɛcogoya tun y'a la ɲuman ye , nk'a da ka gɛlɛn kosɛbɛ .

Publisher 's note : There has been a lot of talk about the Operation Enduring Freedom , in particular by Malian journalists , who have pointed their fingers at the Lebanese Minister of Defense and have gone so far as to accuse him of treason . ||| Gafe goniman : Obɛritiri bɛnkan kuma cayara , o cogo la , Mali kunnafonidilaw fɛ , minnu y'u bolonkɔni jɔ Lakana minisiri la ani ka taa fo k'a jalaki ni yuruguyurugu ye .

Others have suggested an alternative explanation for Ledrian 's interest in the treaty , which is not reflected in his Treasury Department profile : the observatory is not a typical French institution , but one of the best in the British Empire , which is difficult for Jean-Yves Ledrian . ||| Mɔgɔ dɔw ye kun wɛrɛ kɔni labɔ , min bɛ se ka Lediriyan jijakunba ɲɛfɔ bɛnkan kama , min tɛ don kuma na a ka Lakana minisiriso ka kokɛtaw kɔnɔ : Obɛritri tɛ Faransi baarada gansan ye ten , nka Beretaɲi marabolo baarada ɲumanw na ɲuman , min ko ka gɛlɛn Zan - Iwi Lediriyan ma .

Does his portrait of Bertrand explain the French minister 's rise to power ? ||| K'a bisigiya beretɔnko ye , o bɛ Faransi minisiri ka wulikajɔ ɲɛfɔ wa ?
This is what I was told , when I took the job , a former IBEKA minister broke the ice . ||| O de fɔra ne ye , tuma min n ye baara ta , IBEKA ka minisiri kɔrɔ dɔ y'o jalatigɛ .
He was questioned by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs , who disagreed with him : although he admitted that he had advised Mali in its current policy on publications , he admitted that he had never mentioned the Observatory or any other institution to any of his colleagues . ||| A ɲininkalen , Faransi minisiri , min b'u ka jamana ni jamana wɛrɛw cɛkow ɲɛnabɔ , ma sɔn a ma : n'a jɛnna n'a ye k'ale ye Mali jamana ladi a ka bi taabolo ta gafe lakananenw ko la , a b'a tiɲɛtigiya ko ale ma Obɛritiri kofɔ abada walima baarada wɛrɛ , a kumakɛɲɔgɔn kelen si ye .
With Jean-Yves Le Drian , he has the best of all the members of the Breton charity , to the point where , at times , he is accused of some sort of regional comedy . ||| Ni Zan - Iwi Lediriyan ye , Beretɔn dɛmɛdonkulu tɔgɔlamɔgɔ bɛɛ la ɲuman b'a bolo , fo ka se yɔrɔ la , min na , waati dɔw la , a bɛ jalaki ni maraboloko ɲɛnawolomali suguya dɔ ye .
Thanks to him , Shaphan , the renowned sculptor of the Egyptian pyramids , the authorized builder , and the builder of the pyramid complex , which is the largest of its kind , received two of Egypt 's most prestigious sculptural works . ||| A ka bolodon fɛ , Safaran , min ye pankurunko kodɔnnaba ye , n'a dagalen don Fuzɛri , ani nin beretɔn wocɛ baarakɛlaw tabaga ye , min jɔda ka bon bɛɛ ta ye , o ye Misirajamana pankurundi baara ɲɛnamanba fila sɔrɔ .

Tarsus , Nawali Group , or Arkixis ( formerly Rhino Triangle Defense , which was developing its Abu Dhabi plant in 2015 and is supplying weapons to several African militaries ) all have some interest in the area . ||| Talɛsi , Nawali Gurupu , walima Arikiyisi ( Reno Tirikisi Defansi kɔrɔ , min tun b'a ka yiriwabaara kɛ Abu Dabi , san 2015 ani n'a bɛ maramafɛnw di Afiriki kɛlɛbolo caman ma ) olu bɛɛ fana ka fɛndilandaga dɔw bɛ beretɔnni dugukolo kan .
Thereafter , Ledrian never hesitated to approach the Taranto Crisis Club , an organization founded in 1988 and composed of a group of prominent Breton businessmen who were anxious to form a group to exert their influence on the decisions that would be made in Paris . ||| O bɔlen kɔ yen , Lediriyan ma deli ka siga - siga ka gɛrɛ dakabana Kulubu dɛ taranti la , jɛkulu sigilen san 1988 ani n'a bɛ Beretɔn kotigbaw ka jɛrɛjɛkulu sannamɔgɔw fara ɲɔgɔn kan , minnu hami ye ka kɛ kulu ye walasa k'u fanga digi latigɛlisɛbɛnw kan , minnu bɛ ta Pari .

Ledrian draws inspiration from the billionaire Levi Ledif ( Brius Doré , Del Arite , Bridori ) , to whom he donated a lesion in 2012 , and succeeded Jean-Pierre Leroux ( Intermarché , pictured today ) , Daniel Rulier ( Rulier Group ) , Claude Guillaume ( Ibishopric ) or Birisi Rose . ||| Lediriyan bɛ u cɛsiraw juru ɲumanw sama ni miliyaritigi Liwi Ledifu ye ( Biriyɔsi dore , Dɛli Arite , Biridɔri ) , a ye leziyɔn donɛri di min ma san 2012 , an'a sera ka Zan - Piyɛri Lerɔsi ( Ɛntɛrimarise , min ntanyalen don bi ) , Daniyɛli Ruliye ( Gurupu Ruliye ) , Kulodi Giyemo ( Ibisɔfiti ) walima Birisi Rose fana ( olu )

The Research Institute , renamed the Institute of Chartered Accountants , was charged with bringing together the world 's leading accountants to actively participate in the economic life of the province . ||| Ɲininikɛcakɛda , min tɔgɔ seginna ka da Kereden ɲinan , ye ci don a yɛrɛ bolo ka diɲɛ Beretɔnw bɛɛ fara ɲɔgɔn kan walasa u k'u sen don kosɛbɛ a marabolo sɔrɔko taaɲɛ la .

With the Cretan crucifix placed on the right ( as intended by the long-time TIFF-1 co-founder , Patrick Laleigh ) , as a symbol of patriotism and patriotism , socialism never failed to gain a foothold . ||| Ni Kereden kulusigira ka bila kininyanfan fɛ ( a laɲagara ka waati jan kɛ TEYƐFI - 1 kotigi , Patiriki Lelayi fɛ ) , ni k'a cogoya fɔ i ko kannabilalenya ani jamanadenya baaradanin , sosiyalisikɛ ma ban abada ka to k'a sen jɔ yen .
In 2004 , he delivered a critique in front of a Beretonian audience of about 300 people , alongside Peter Meighenry or French Guillaume , some of the region 's leading figures , in Nikola Sarkosy 's IYEMIPE . ||| San 2004 kɔnɔ , a ye kɔrɔfɔ dɔ fɔ yen , Beretɔn kolatigɛlaw ɲɛ na , minnu bɛ ɲini ka mɔgɔ 300 bɔ , Piyɛri Mehɛɲeri kɛrɛ la walima Faransuwa Gulari , marabolo mɔgɔba dɔw , Nikola Sarikosi ka IYƐMIPE kɔnɔ .
Figure 1 : Between 2012 and 2015 , according to his Foreign Office , Jean-Yves Le Drian made 153 trips to the interior of France , of which 53 were to Britain alone . ||| Jateden min bɛ faamuyali di : san 2012 ni 2015 cɛ , a ka jamanabaara baarabolodasɛbɛn ka fɔ la , Zan - Iwi Lediriyan ye taama 153 kɛ ka taa Faransi kɔnɔna maraw la , minnu na 53 kɛra Beretaɲi kelen na .
During his time as Minister of Defence , two members of his cabinet were also appointed to deal with Breton affairs , and the Chancellor of the Hôtel de Bretagne frequently met his provincial deputies at his cabinet or participated , on occasion , in meetings of the British Chamber of Commerce International ( BESEYI ) . ||| Waati min a tun ye Lakana minisiri ye , a ka cakɛda mɔgɔ fila tun bilala fana ka ɲɛsin beretɔni koɲɛw ma , ani Hotɛli de Biriyɛnni kofigiba tun bɛ a ka marabolo depitew fara ɲɔgɔn kan ka caya , a ka minisiriso la walima a tun b'a sen don , waati dɔw la , Beretaɲi komɛrisi ɛntɛrinasiyɔnali ( BESEYI ) ka

In the eyes of the more than 200 leading institutions that make up BESEYI , its mission can be summed up in two words : that we take an active role in the development of Africa . ||| Baarada 200 tɔgɔlamɔgɔw ɲɛ na , minnu bɛ BESEYI kɔnɔ , a y'a ka waleya fara ɲɔgɔn kan kumasen fila kɔnɔ : fo an k'an jɔyɔrɔ bɛɛ minɛ Afiriki yiriwali la .

Mamadu TOGOLA / maliweb.net - Dedicated to the building of peace and reconciliation in Mali , the Muslim Brotherhood and its Tumutu-SIYATI affiliated groups have joined forces to denounce all those who seek to undermine the policies of our country 's top leaders . ||| Mamadu TOGOLA / maliweb . net - A donnen wulikajɔ la , bɛn ani bɛnɲini kama Mali keɲeka la , Imusagiw an'u ka Tumutu - SIYATI jɛw ka jamakulu bɛɛ sen bɛ don min na bɛ kankarida kɛ sifilɛlibaga bɛɛ ye , minnu b'a ɲini ka tiɲɛni kɛ an ka jamana ɲɛmɔgɔbabaw ka maganw na .
In its statement on this occasion , dated April 5 , 2021 , Imusagi and the entire community of Tumutu-SIYATI associations participated in the free , voluntary , and accountable distribution of the videos of the events organized by Dire , which are related to the right to discrimination , Alize . ||| A ka dantigɛlisɛbɛn kɔnɔ nin ntɛnɛn , awirili tile 5 san 2021 , Imusagiw an'u ka Tumutu - SIYATI jɛw ka jamakulu bɛɛ sen bɛ don min na ye kunnafonibɔliw lakɔlɔsi , ni sɔnja ani nisɔngoya ye , k'u kɛ wideyo , minnu labɛnniw kɛra Dire , n'u bɛ tali kɛ farafarali hakilila kan , Alize

To the maximum extent possible , these videos are monitored , edited and disseminated for their own purposes , by some members of the Dire family , without any representation or recognition by any of the parties involved . ||| N'a se dan bɛɛ ye , a b'o kunnafonibɔliw kɔn , minnu bilalen don wideyow kɔnɔ , k'u lamara ani k'u jɛnsɛn ka ko ɲini n'a ye , Dire denmisɛn dɔw fɛ , ni jamaden kofɔlenw fan si jɔyɔrɔ ma di minnu ma ani yamaruya si .
POLITICS condemns all hate speech that seeks to create division and recalls that the publication of such statements should in no way violate the limited presidential powers derived from the diversity of the human race . ||| SIYATI bɛ kankarida kɛ ka sin kuma juguw bɛɛ ma , minnu b'a ɲini ka tilali kɛ an'a bɛ hakililatigɛ kɛ k'o ɲɔgɔnna kunnafonibɔliw jirali man kan cogo si la ka perezidanfanga danbew tiɲɛ minnu bɛ bɔ Dire kubeda hadamadenya suguya cayali la .
Imusagi and the entire Tumutu-SIYATI alliance joined in reiterating its commitment to the people of Dire , to the government of Mali , to the signatories , who are the permanent members of the presidential staff . ||| Imusagiw an'a ka Tumutu - SIYATI jɛw ka jamakulu bɛɛ sen bɛ don min na bɛ segin a kan k'a ka sirili fɔ , Dire jama ye , Mali gɔfɛrɛnaman na , tɔn bolonɔbilalaw , minnu ye an'u tolen don perezidanfanga mɔgɔ ye .
After that , he buries the signatories of the treaty to keep their commitments , which came from the Treaty of Algiers . ||| O bɔlen kɔ yen , o la , a bɛ fan bolonɔbilalaw su , u k'u ka kandiw labato , minnu bɔra Alize bɛnkansɛbɛn kɔnɔ .
SIYATI continues to support all initiatives in the field of Human Rights and Equal Opportunity in Dire and other regional bodies . ||| SIYATI bɛ to dɛmɛdon na waleyali bɛɛ ye hadamabenya bɛn sira la ani Jɛkasigi la Dire ani marabolo kubeda tɔw kɔnɔ .
With a clear sense of social responsibility in mind , Imusagi and the entire Tumutu-SIYATI community participated in the commemoration of the victims of the massacre , which included 116 people from 212 villages and tribes in 22 provincial communes , 5 sectors . ||| K'a ka hadamadenya labɛncogo jɛlen to a hakilila la , Imusagiw an'a ka Tumutu - SIYATI jɛw ka jamakulu bɛɛ sen bɛ don min na bɛ hakilijigin kɛ ko wote kɛra komini mɔgɔ minnu ye , olu mɔgɔ 116 b'olu cɛla , ka bɔ duguninw ani kabilabondaw 212 la , marabolo komini 22 kɔnɔ , sɛrɛkili 5
and to every creature on the earth . ||| dugukolo kan , Dire bɛ minnu na .
Because of this role , he strongly opposes the practices of jealousy and nepotism in the Dire kubeda valley , as in other communities of the Tumutu region and Duwanza , and more recently , Isaka Mayiga , who is said to have been kidnapped by the Larabo and disappeared with him and the two children of Duwanza . ||| O jɔyɔrɔ kosɔn , a bɛ ɲankata ani fɔlɔmɔgɔya walew kɔn ni barika ye Dire kubeda kɛnɛ kɔnɔ , i n'a fɔ Tumutu marabolo sigida tɔw la ani Duwanza , ni kɔsa in na , Isaka Mayiga a bɛ fɔ min ma Larabo minɛni ka tunun n'a ye bɛ minnu na ani Duwanza denmisɛn fila .
Similarly , it calls on the Government of Mali , as well as the signatories of the Algiers Accord , to make every effort to renew the humanitarian and individual commitments undertaken to the maximum extent possible , for the peace of the peoples they represent . ||| O cogo kelen na , a bɛ Mali gɔfɛrɛnaman wele , ani Alize bɛnkansɛbɛn bolonɔbilalaw fana , u k'u magan cogo bɛɛ la walasa ka hadamadenya juru tugu kura ye ani ka bɛɛ kelenkelenna ye kandi minnu kɛ ka bila sen kan fo a dan , jamadenw ka hɛrɛ kama u bɛ minnu nɔnabila .
Finally , he reiterated his readiness to work in partnership with all stakeholders involved in the restoration and reconciliation of humanity in Mali , which is fragmented and multi-ethnic . ||| K'a laban , a seginna a kan k'a jira k'a labɛnnen don k'a baara kɛ cɛsiri kɔnɔ ni fanw mɔgɔ ye , minnu sen bɛ bɛn seginni ani hadamadenya ɲɔgɔnfaamu na Mali kɔnɔ , min faralen don ɲɔgɔn kan ani ka suguyaw caya a kɔnɔ .
Following the events of Friday , June 18th , the Cabal 's Coalition Against Hangings held a local rally opposing the use of the gallows in the Cabal . ||| Berehima Jalo - Zuwɛnkalo tile 18 jumaseli kɔfɛ , Kabala gaw ka faraɲɔgɔnkankulu dulɔminyɔrɔw kɛlɛli kama ye yɔrɔdalasigi masumanen dɔ kɛ , k'a fɔ u tɛ sɔn dulɔminyɔrɔw sigili ma Kabala kɔnɔ , k'a kɛ bayaa ye .
The practice is described as a form of misconduct , committed in this case by buyers of a door hanger . ||| O wale bɛ ɲɛfɔ ni baara cɛjuguw ye , minnu kɛra kosa in na dafɛla dulɔminyɔrɔ dɔ sannikɛlaw fɛ .

The event , which took place in Kabala Wardha , was attended by Kabala scholar , Isaac Bacili , with Muslim Youth President , Aruna Keita , at his side , and members of the Kabala faction against apartheid , including President Suleimani Ibrahim Khamis and members of the opposition . ||| O yɔrɔdalasigi , min kɛra Kabala Wɛrɛda la , kɛra Kabala alimami , Isaka Bacili , ɲɛna , silamɛdenmisɛnw ka prezidan , Aruna Keyita , tun b'a kɛrɛfɛ , ani Kabala gaw ka faraɲɔgɔnkankulu dulɔfeereyɔrɔw kɛlɛli kama perzidan , Suleyimani Berehima Kamisoko ani sigidamɔgɔw bɔlen ka
The response to the call was overwhelming . ||| caya kosɛbɛ ka wele jaabi .
Following the reopening of the so-called " restricted " " Cabbage Patch " by a municipal decree , three months after its closure , the founders of the " Cabbage Patch " posted on the " Cabbage Patch " page to express their disapproval of the decision . ||| Dulɔminyɔrɔ dɔ min bɛ wele """" Namara ka bari , """" min dagalen bɛ Kabala , de dayɛlɛnni kɔfɛ kokura , meri ka latigɛlisɛbɛn dɔ fɛ , kalo saba a datuguli kɔ , Kabala sigibagaw ye hii kɛ """" Kabala Wɛrɛda """" kan , k'u sɔnbaliya jira k'a ɲɛsin nin kiri

There were many , of all ages , Kabbalistic men and women , who set foot in these shelters . ||| U tun ka ca , si hakɛ bɛɛ , Kabala cɛw ani musow , k'u sen don nin yɔrɔdalasigi la .
Thus , the decision of the president of the Muslim Brotherhood , Aruna Keita , to reveal this intention explained the nature of the royal family . ||| O la , silamɛdenmisɛnw ka perezidan , Aruna Keyita , ka dantigɛli de ye nin ŋaniya jira masumanen kɔnɔko ɲɛfɔ .
I mean , if there 's a lot of robbers , thieves , or drunkards , what hope can one have for these kids ? ||| A ka fɔ la , ni dulɔfeereyɔrɔ cayali ye , minnu bɛ dulɔ mandiya walima dɔrɔgu , mɔgɔ bɛ se k'i jigi da mun kan nin denmisɛnw ye ?
Children , can we have confidence in future generations when they indulge in such vices as drunkenness and gluttony ? ||| Denmisɛn , minnu ye siniɲɛsigi ye , n'olu b'u yɛrɛ di nin ɲɔgɔnna jogujuguya ma , n'o ye dɔrɔguta ani kota ye , an bɛ se k'an jigi da olu kan wa ?
Certainly not ! The Creator threw it into the wind and it became a whirlwind . ||| Tiɲɛ na , ayi , Keyitakɛ y'o fili fiɲɛ fɛ k'o kɛ cikan ye .
He went on to argue that hangings do no good and that this relocation was in complete violation of the laws of the land and the duty of public safety . ||| A tɛmɛna ni kuma ye ko dulɔminyɔrɔw tɛ na ni foyi ye ɲuman na ani ko nin yɔrɔdalasigi kɛra jamana josariyaw batoli dafalen kɔnɔ ani jamaw ka kannabila baara kɛta .
No one ever touches the hanging , and no one has ever seen a hanging like it . ||| Mɔgɔw tɛ dɔwɛrɛ ɲini nin dulɔminyɔrɔ in datuguli kɔ ; mɔgɔ m'a ye abada nin yɔrɔ ɲɔgɔnna ka komini layiriwa .
This decision marked the end of our departure , and if he ( the owner of the cloak ) did not cover it , we would stand in our position and lose our temper , he did so as a warning . ||| Nin ŋaniyajira in y'an ka bɔli laban ye , n'a ( dulɔso tigi ) m'a datugu , an bɛna an jɔ an jɔyɔrɔ la ani an tɛna an yɛrɛ minɛ , a y'o kɛ lasɔminikan ye .

In response to the Cabal 's crackdown on gang-related hangings , the president , Suleimani Berehima Kamisoko , stated in a statement that no one will be held accountable for the Cabal 's actions and that no one knows the consequences of such hangings , including kidnappings , murders , and torture . ||| Kabala gaw ka faraɲɔgɔnkankulu dulɔsow kɛlɛli kama perezidan , Suleyimani Berehima Kamisoko , kumakuncɛ la , y'i kanto ko mɔgɔ si tɛna Kabala layiriwa olu nɔ na ani ko mɔgɔ si t'a dɔn degun minnu b'u kan nin dulɔminyɔrɔ kosɔn , i n'a fɔ binkanniw , mɔgɔfaga ani

In addition , like the speakers before him , he announced that the end of this neighborhood would be a lesson to the cloakroom owners and their neighbors , as the purpose of the uprising was to fight against cloaks , against clothing , against corruption , and against " " " " smuggling " " . ||| K'a fara a kan , i ko mɔgɔ minnu kumana a ɲɛ , a y'a lase ko nin yɔrɔdalasigi y'a laban ye an'a bɛna kɛ kalansen ye dulɔsotigi bolo an'a laminiw , bawo nin wulikajɔ kun ye ka dulɔminyɔrɔw kɛlɛ , ka dulɔ kɛlɛ , ka siramɔɲɔ ani """" sisa """" kɛlɛ .

However , officials seem to forget that in July 2020 , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) warned that in the near future , Mali and 26 other countries will face a food crisis due to COVID-19 . ||| Nka , a bɛ i ko ɲɛmɔgɔbabaw bɛ ka ɲina ko zuluyekalo san 2020 , Diɲɛ Baloko ni Sɛnɛko Tɔnba ( FAWO ) ani Diɲɛ Baloko Baarabolodali Cakɛdaba ( FAWO ) ye lasɔmini kɛ ko waati surun kɔnɔ , baloko gɛlɛya kun bɛ Mali ani jamana 26 wɛrɛw kan , Kowidi - 19 kosɔn .
According to FAO and WFP , COVID-19 appears to be exacerbating the problem of hunger , based on a decrease in unemployment , with the consequence that the poor will receive less money for their food bills and the displaced workers will send less money to their families . ||| FAWO ni PAMU ka fɔ la , Kovidi - 19 bɛ kɛ i ko a bɛ dɔ fara degunw kan minnu sirilen don kɔngɔ la , k'a da baara kundama jiginni kan , min kɔlɔlɔ ye ko gaw bɛna wari sɔrɔ k'a dɔgɔya u ka dumuni musaka kama ani baarakɛla minnu taalen don babakɔfɛ bɛna wari dɔgɔmanw ci u ka denbaya ma ,

The aim of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Authority of Mali ( SONATAMU ) is to control the manufacture , importation , marketing , and distribution of cigarettes in Mali . Considering that the construction of a new factory is a violation of the agreement , " Dinihili International " ( " Dinihili International " ) manufactures and distributes cigarettes in Mali , which ||| Mali Jamana Siramɔɲɔw ani Takalaw Baarada ( SONATAMU ) ka laɲini ye sigɛrɛti dilanni ye , a tali ka na jamana kɔnɔ , a jagoli , an'a lataali yɔrɔw la .

In his opening remarks to his guest , SONATAMU DEZE would state that the creation of a " " " " Dinihili International " " " " brand in the country would lead to an increase in the company 's employment rate , an increase in the revenue of the National Tax Fund and an increase in the number of state-owned enterprises . ||| A ka ɲɛfɔli kumaw kɔnɔ a ka a don dunan ye , SONATAMU DEZE bɛna fɔ ko """" Dinihili Ɛntɛrinasiyɔnali """" suguya dilanni jamana kɔnɔ , bɛna kɛ ka dɔ fara a baarada ka baara toli la senna , an'a bɛna dɔ fara Jamana lɛnpo wari sɔrɔtaw kan ani jamana iziniw caya .
This , according to him , will put SONATAMU in a position to become one of the best enterprises in Mali , allowing its products to be manufactured and exported abroad , for the benefit of all the countries of the northern branch . ||| Ko min , ka da a ka kuma na , bɛna SONATAMU bila yɔrɔ la , k'a kɛ Mali iziniw bɛɛ la ɲuman , k'a to a ka siramafɛnw dilanyɔrɔko an'u lataaliko la jamana kɔkan , fankelenyanfan bolofara jamanaw bɛɛlajɛlen kama .
